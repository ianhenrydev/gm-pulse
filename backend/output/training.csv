"To the people from the frontpage, who came here without any idea what is going on:  This  thread is about football. Not your american football, but the *real* football. This was the second leg of the Round of 16 between Paris Saint German and FC Barcelona in the Champions League. In the first leg Paris won 4-0 and beat the favorites by a huge margin.   There is a special rule about away goals in Football cups like the Champions League. If both legs end with the same goal difference - e g. 2:0 and 1:3, then the team with more away goals reaches the next round. This was the case in the second leg. Paris scored the important away goal, so a 5:1 for Barcelona wouldn't be enough to qualify for the quarter finals. So they needed 6 (!) goals, which was more or less impossible.  In the 88th minute the score was 3:1. So there were only 2 minutes left + 5 minutes of injury time. Barcelona managed to do the impossible and score 3 goals in the last minutes. This video is the last goal in the 90+5th minute of the game, literally the last chance of the match. This match is comparable with the last super bowl match with the Patriots. Unbelievable.

"What a joke. Blatant dive by a player already on yellow for diving.","pos"
"It's not a joke, it's the game. You people really need to realize that instead of seriously complaining and feeling outrageous.  They dive because it works. You would too. The games they don't dive are the games that they don't desperately need to win, but that's it.  It's not even the ref's fault, they're allowed to feel pressure and make mistakes. The best ones are the ones that do it less, not the ones that never do it.   It's just how this game is, and have always been. Unless you punish the player/organization after the match with replays and stuff like that, it'll keep happening, and it seems like you guys will keep complaining.  edit: I know you're pissed and all, I'm not saying to not be pissed. Just don't be silly and act as if a player diving was something outrageous, and that the Ref should know better. Suarez did what he had to do and in perfect position to mess up the Ref's call.","pos"
"That doesn't make it any less of a joke, Suarez was already playing on a yellow for simulation and this was more of the same. It's a big problem, regardless of whether or not it's commonplace or good strategy. Neymar and Suarez were doing it all game and it certainly paid dividends for the team, which is exactly why people are outraged. Maybe PSG needs to get their shit together and not allow so many goals, but those two penalties were the total difference in the game and both were won by players that spent the entire match flopping around.","neg"
"&gt;but those two penalties were the total difference  Talking about the first penalty makes you seem biased. It wasn't on purpose, but it was a penalty.  Suarez totally dove. Do you think he did the wrong thing? Do you think you would've done anything different?  But most important, do you honestly think PSG players wouldn't have done it, if the opportunity arose in that game, or any other one? ","pos"
"I'm not in here arguing that it isn't the winning strategy, but I think it's obvious from the di Maria tackle just a few minutes earlier that PSG either wasn't intent on flopping around or that the refs weren't going to call it for them.  Given the rules of the game Suarez et. al. are clearly doing whatever they can to win the game and they can hardly be faulted, but the fact that it's winning strategy to play outside of the spirit/intent of the game is what's so frustrating to watch as a fan. Teams that are willing to go all out, to the extent where their players are sent off for faking too much, are being rewarded. To me, there's something inherently wrong with that and the players and teams who employ that strategy should be punished.","neg"
"Its part of the denial of the defeat i think (or just straight up hatred for barcelona). The first penalty was blatant for sure. The second one wasn't but propably looked like it from behind (where the ref was standing) so I can atleast understand why the call was made. The Di Maria one was not a penalty (I think he was down on the ground out of frustration for blowing the chance, not injury)","pos"
"Defending diving.... incredible.   It is outrageous. If the cunt was carded for all good dives he wouldn't be on the pitch. Same with Neymar. ","pos"

"Hello people from r/all. Here's a description about the importance of the goal. There's a tournament called the Champions League, where the best teams in Europe play at this stage of the tournament. There are always 2 games between those teams, where one team plays at home and away. Now, the first time they played, Barcelona lost 4-0 to PSG. Everyone thought it was over. There has been 0 teams in the history coming back from such a deficit. No one was really expecting anything, but as the game started, Barcelona scored an early goal. During first half time, Barcelona were leading 2-0 (still 2 goals away). Then, at second half, Barcelona scored another early goal making it 3-0. Now they are 1 goal away. There's about 40 minutes left to play and everyone got hyped up and were looking at an historical moment, atleast for a start. As the hype built up, Barcelona conceded a goal making it 3-1. This means Barcelona must win with atleast 6 goals. This 3-1 scoreline was within the last 20 minutes of the game, and the hype that was built up, was soon vanished. I mean, who can score 3 goals in 20 minutes against a top tier team? Anyway, as the game went on, Barcelona scored 4-1. Everyone was like, meh, a goal that doesn't mean much. Then 5-1 came, with a few more minutes to play. Then the unbelievable happened and they actually turned it around, and the goal in the video is the last goal they needed to advance and qualify, and it really happened. All in all, no one expected a advancement from Barcelona. But as they took the lead early on, everyone was building up hype and soon came the counter goal and the hype was dead until they turned it around by 3 magical last minute goals.

"This was absolutely more PSG throwing it away than Barcelona winning it.   6-1 in all it's honor, but it's not exactly like Barcelona put in a performance that merited a 6-1 result: first goal coming from a confused PSG defence, 3 goals from setpieces, where the penalties were iffy, and 1 own goal. Compare this performance to Bayerns first leg 5-1 win over Arsenal. Despite the fact that Bayern and Barca are two different teams facing two completely different oppositions, Bayern absolutely dominated that game and with their play, 5-1 was not the strangest result in the world (albeit a humiliating one for Arsenal). But with PSG coming in with probably their finest game in their club history, they absolutely should have done better. All respect to Barcelona though. Despite that I don't agree with the second penalty, they made the most with what they got and got the result they needed. ","pos"

"2 penalties, 1 own goal and 5+ minutes extra time  my only question is: how much did they pay for this","pos"
"As a person that is coming from all, why is it a big deal that a team won 6-1 vs 5-1? ","pos"
"Because it's an aggregate score over 2 matches. PSG won the first 4-0 at home. So had barcelona only won 5-1 it would have been 5-5 overall. In those instances the team with the most goals scored away from home is the winner (eventually goes to penaltys if it's still equal) ","pos"
"PSG won the first leg with 4-0 at home. This means that Barca ould have needed a 4-0 as well to go into over time, or a 5-0 to proceed into the next round directly.  PSG scored one goal though. You would think that that means that Barcelona need a 5-1 to go into overtime (making it a 5-5 aggregate), but in soccer there is an away goal rule, in which an away goal is weighed heavier than a home goal, meaning that in case of a 5-5 aggregate, PSG proceeds directly. There can be no extra time.   So, to proceed, Barca needed a 6-1 win, and they did it, going from 3-1 to 6-1 within seven minutes or so.  This is incredible. ","pos"
"The away goals rule. Basically if you score a goal away from home, it counts as a tie-breaker. So if this match had ended 5-1, then the aggregate score would have been 5-5 (PSG won 4-0 at home in the first leg) but PSG would have advanced due to having scored a goal away from home (whereas Barca didn't score in Paris).","pos"
"PSG won the first game 4-0. That means Barcelona would have to equal that in this second game to send it to extra time, win 5-0 to move on or win by 5 goals if PSG score 1 because of the away goals rule. Basically 185 teams have led 4-0 after the first leg and this is the first time in history a team has come back in the second leg to move on ","pos"
"Hello from /r/all!  Can someone explain to a non-soccer watcher how a team could 'blow a 4-0 lead' and then lose 6-1?","pos"
"There are two games played between the teams. The team that advances is based on the combined (aggregate) score between the two games. ","pos"
"The way the tournament works is they play two games each team having 1 home game. In the first game Paris Saint Germaine won 4-0 at home. Then Barcelona at home scored 6 goals and PSG scored 1. The overall final score of the two games was 6-5 but they lost the second game 6-1","pos"
"They had a four-nil advantage from the first leg, conceded thrice, scored once (giving them an away goal, which count double), then conceded thrice more, leaving them a goal down overall. Hope this helps.","pos"
"Can I get some context here? What is meant by a 4 - 0 lead? What does it mean they won by ""aggregate"" 6 - 5?  Thank you.","pos"
"Correct, they win 6-5 on aggregate.  What's even more incredible, is they also overturned an away-goal advantage.","pos"

Then in tennis we somehow we had another showdown between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in a finals match. Something no one thought we'd see again.

Sometimes players just ""feel it"" and get a great tap of them and send them to just the right place at the right time, which this obviously was because he did it so far out and it knicked the crossbar. This goal is more of a testament to Giroud's instinct than his actual skill. Not to take anything away from this goal, but this took more luck than skill. Giroud is a good striker, but this isn't anything outside the ability of most strikers. It just takes a really good redirect and the gumption of trying something that will result in a loss of possession 99.9% of the time.  ","pos"

"&gt; you win by exploiting the mistakes of your opponent.  The bad pass here is from *the teammate*.  If the ball does't arrive a yard behind Giroud, there would be no scorpion kick. ","pos"
"Agreed. Goals like this happen out of luck and just hopeful desperation. Sure this does takes instinct and skill, but it wasnt Giroud's intention to kiss the crossbar with that flick. He was slinging his foot up trying to make something happen in the box. Give the guy 1000 chances to recreate that goal, and he couldn't. By that undeniable fact, it's a lucky goal. Still sweet, but incredibly lucky.   Idk, it could be that I'm biased, but seeing these types of goals don't impress me as much as something like this: https://streamable.com/0aqy8. How Messi wraps the ball around the outside of his foot at the 57 sec mark is more impressive to me than Giroud's scorpion kick. Idk if it was because I played myself so I know there is a huge luck factor with what Giroud did vs what individual talent actually looks like. I'm not trying to be a dick either.

"Bingo. Ignore the downvotes. This was just a hopeful desperation and it paid off. It took instinct and Giroud has that. But give Giroud 1000s chances to recreate that and have him kiss the crossbar like that and he wouldn't be able to replicate it again. That means it was luck. It took some skill of course but every professional striker playing the game in every league on earth has the ability to do what Giroud just did. It's so hard that it will always be unintentional, because no one can actually ""mean to"" place a flick like that  routinely. 1/1000. Still awesome, but people need to realize that this goal is  a circus novelty rather than intention put on display. Just an amazingly impressive lucky shot in the end.    ","pos"

"Ignore the downvotes. Seriously. These people don't have a clue what it takes to pull off a circus flick like this routinely, hence why Giroud (or anyone in history) don't have multiple goals doing shit like this. It was a lucky, instinctive flick. Give Giroud 1000 chances to replicate it (kissing the bar and everything) and he wouldn't be able to. Most of his chances wouldn't even make it to the goal, much less actually score on a goalkeeper. It's obvious this was luck. Does it take away from the ""awesomeness"" of it? No, not really. Cool ass circus flick. But does the luck factor take away from the ""impressiveness"" of it? Yes, absolutely.   I posted it here already but I'm more impressed at the 57 sec mark of this video of Messi than I am with Giroud's goal: https://streamable.com/0aqy8. One is a display of godlike skill with a simple tap of the outside foot and the other is a lucky flick that almost anyone can do (it's just that it only happens 1/1000 chances so it's awesome when it does. But awesome isn't the same as impressive. Giroud's was awesome, but it wasn't impressive, because that implies intention).   ","pos"

"You seem deluded.  Mkhis goal was the one with no one marking him, and last minute where United are already winning. No real pressure to score it.  Giroud was involved in the buildup from the start, ran from the halfway line, got delivered a pretty bad cross by sanchez, improvized with an acrobatic scorpion kick being right behind flamini trying to head it away and 2 defenders coming from his back.

"Imagine waking up from a coma, seeing Leicester crowned Premier League Champions and Spurs 2nd.   Meanwhile, fans of Arsenal (3rd), Man U (5th) and Liverpool (8th) are cheering for Chelsea who are barely scraping a top half finish.   Crazy. Proud of my boys. Impossible task the way this seasons narrative have gone. We've gone from playing the best football and not being recognised for it, to being plastered in the media as the big boys out to crash Leicester's party - [all while doing this massive favour to football](http://imgur.com/dyLAA2b).  Not to mention the schedule, which saw us play after Leicester (on a Monday no less) for the remaining 4 (or 5?) games of the season.  Still. Congratulations to Leicester and to Jamie Vardy especially, who's performances this season allowed for his right to be forgotten as a racist. You have to be in that special calibre of footballer - I'm talking [Terry](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19723020), I'm talking [Suarez](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16186556), I'm talking [Sergio Busquets](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/943733-luis-surez-and-10-other-footballers-who-have-been-accused-of-racism/page/7), - to be so warmly accepted after such remarks. Massive achievement.  EDIT: Forgot to mention the father of everybody's favourite father son Goalkeeping duo, [Peter Schmeichel](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/943733-luis-surez-and-10-other-footballers-who-have-been-accused-of-racism/page/10).  Still. Excited for these last two games. 3 points will see us secure second - massive achievement in its own right.   I'm excited to see what happens in the transfer window - I expect Leicester will be raided and the big boys will panic buy. We'll probably convert a young Centre Back academy project to a 15 goal a season second striker.  And finally - I'm excited for the euros. With our lot in that team, a few of the Leicester boys, and whatever shite we can scrape together from the big clubs, England might actually have a decent run.","pos"
"&gt; We've gone from playing the best football  The best football is played by the best team.

I hear this comment from Tottenham fans all the time. However, I never hear it from someone else...  &gt;Still. Congratulations to Leicester and to Jamie Vardy especially, who's performances this season allowed for his right to be forgotten as a racist.   Oh, whining and bitching, are we?  ","pos"
"This idea that the most points on the board is directly equal to playing the best football is nonsense. Leicester were better at winning games. That doesn't mean playing good football to do it. Just 2 games ago Leicester were in a rut of 1-0 wins that they scraped after teams couldn't stick the ball into an open goal from 6 yards out.  But then, there's a lot of opinion in football. Unfortunately only some of those are from people that actually watched the games they're talking about. I'm not begrudging Leicester for those ropey performances either. They knew how to grind out games which is a great asset for a football team to have. Does grinding out games = great football? Ask everybody watching Chelsea last year. If you don't wanna go back and watch, every single stat apart from the points on the board indicate the football from the Spurs lot was the best this year. Or you could listen to one of the many managers that came out and said how we're the best team they played.   &gt; Oh, whining and bitching, are we?  As a black guy who's watched football for 15 years of the 22 I've been about, I'd like to get to the point where racist footballers are banned, and not just given the slap on the wrist we've come to accept. I've seen absolutely zero progress since I've been following football. Yeah, fair enough Leicester have won the league, but I'll NEVER let anybody forget a racist. I don't give a fuck how good a footballer he is and it's disgusting that such a player should be awarded the WRITER'S award. The same **WRITERS** that ran the reports about his remarks in the first place.  Pointing out the hypocrisy in football support and racism is ""whining and bitching"".

Winners but not great winners or legendary teams which is what we all want to see.  All of the big sides have been poor this season and are going through managerial changes. This season was Arsenal's chance to take the reigns (the last big side in the race) but because they bottled it which opened the door for Leicester or Spurs to win. ","pos"

"From an American perspective, how I've tried to explain why the miraculous Leicester season is once-in-a-lifetime to my non-soccer friends: In American sports leagues - MLB, NBA, etc. - the playoffs serve as a nice buffer, in a way. A 'bad' team like the 76ers does not have to be the best in the league during the regular season; in fact, they only need to be one of the eight best in their conference (16 of the 30 teams make the playoffs). Sure, if they went through the playoffs and won the NBA finals, it would absolutely be a huge underdog story, but we all know the adage that anything can happen come playoff-time. Often, playoffs are decided simply by who has a hot or cold streak of form. The Premier League doesn't have playoffs at the end of the season. Leicester City will have had 38 grueling games in a very competitive league, and by the end of it, they will (presumably) be on top. They don't have the luxury of just being one of the x best teams, having a chance to regroup before the playoffs, and then going on a great run to win the title. This team has, over the course of about 13 months, gone from the worst team in the league to the best, and a 38-game season with no playoffs tells me that their rise hasn't been a fluke. Really, only Montpellier and Kaiserslautern can even slightly compare in terms of magnitude, and even then, Leicester being 20th for much of last season gives them the edge in terms of in my opinion.","pos"
"WE DID IT REDDIT","pos"
"#LISTEN UP BOYS  I have so many emotions. SO MANY. That was one of the best games I've ever seen, and it was a 2-2 draw! Leicester are finally champions, and at our hand. Hazard is truly a world class player. (what a beautiful strike! Upper 90!) Ranieri has won the league at Stamford Bridge. Tottenham are scum (Absolute scum!) and deserved probably 3 or 4 reds in that match. Spurs, your dreams die at Stamford Bridge. 55 years, 55 more. Long live Leicester City, and attributed to Chelsea. We've basically won the league twice: Once for ourselves, once for Leicester. The FA is going to have a long day tomorrow evaluating all the possible things they could do from  what happened in today's match. The attempted eye gouge, the step on the hand, the multiple horrific tackles (somehow no reds!). But today, boys. Today I'm happy. Because Leicester have won the league, Tottenham has not, and we've held the fortress at Stamford Bridge. Come on you Blues.   P. S: I know my flair is Saint Louis FC, that's my local club. I'm a diehard Blue too. ","pos"

Factors in Bradley's favor:  * Opposing goalkeeper Ochoa was in a much better position than Lloris.  * The altitude at Estadio Azteca (7200 ft/2200 m) makes it harder to get the ball over the keeper and back down.  * Somewhat harder to steal the ball in Bradley's case, whereas Lloris nearly passed it to Toivonen.","pos"
"Lol @ the altitude","pos"
"Talk about mountains out of mole hills.","pos"
"I'd also add that in the 93rd minute with an open goal you've only got 1 option. Bradley had a ton more that he could've tried given it was the 6th minute and he had support coming.   It is impressive to take the decision he did. If anyone was in Toivonen's spot they would've had a crack.","pos"
