"To the people from the frontpage, who came here without any idea what is going on:  This  thread is about football. Not your american football, but the *real* football. This was the second leg of the Round of 16 between Paris Saint German and FC Barcelona in the Champions League. In the first leg Paris won 4-0 and beat the favorites by a huge margin.   There is a special rule about away goals in Football cups like the Champions League. If both legs end with the same goal difference - e g. 2:0 and 1:3, then the team with more away goals reaches the next round. This was the case in the second leg. Paris scored the important away goal, so a 5:1 for Barcelona wouldn't be enough to qualify for the quarter finals. So they needed 6 (!) goals, which was more or less impossible.  In the 88th minute the score was 3:1. So there were only 2 minutes left + 5 minutes of injury time. Barcelona managed to do the impossible and score 3 goals in the last minutes. This video is the last goal in the 90+5th minute of the game, literally the last chance of the match. This match is comparable with the last super bowl match with the Patriots. Unbelievable.

"Suarez dived to get a penalty. Was already on a yellow (for another dive). Should have been sent off.","pos"
"What a joke. Blatant dive by a player already on yellow for diving.","pos"
"It's not a joke, it's the game. You people really need to realize that instead of seriously complaining and feeling outrageous.  They dive because it works. You would too. The games they don't dive are the games that they don't desperately need to win, but that's it.  It's not even the ref's fault, they're allowed to feel pressure and make mistakes. The best ones are the ones that do it less, not the ones that never do it.   It's just how this game is, and have always been. Unless you punish the player/organization after the match with replays and stuff like that, it'll keep happening, and it seems like you guys will keep complaining.  edit: I know you're pissed and all, I'm not saying to not be pissed. Just don't be silly and act as if a player diving was something outrageous, and that the Ref should know better. Suarez did what he had to do and in perfect position to mess up the Ref's call.","pos"
"That doesn't make it any less of a joke, Suarez was already playing on a yellow for simulation and this was more of the same. It's a big problem, regardless of whether or not it's commonplace or good strategy. Neymar and Suarez were doing it all game and it certainly paid dividends for the team, which is exactly why people are outraged. Maybe PSG needs to get their shit together and not allow so many goals, but those two penalties were the total difference in the game and both were won by players that spent the entire match flopping around.","neg"
"&gt;but those two penalties were the total difference  Talking about the first penalty makes you seem biased. It wasn't on purpose, but it was a penalty.  Suarez totally dove. Do you think he did the wrong thing? Do you think you would've done anything different?  But most important, do you honestly think PSG players wouldn't have done it, if the opportunity arose in that game, or any other one? ","pos"
"I'm not in here arguing that it isn't the winning strategy, but I think it's obvious from the di Maria tackle just a few minutes earlier that PSG either wasn't intent on flopping around or that the refs weren't going to call it for them.  Given the rules of the game Suarez et. al. are clearly doing whatever they can to win the game and they can hardly be faulted, but the fact that it's winning strategy to play outside of the spirit/intent of the game is what's so frustrating to watch as a fan. Teams that are willing to go all out, to the extent where their players are sent off for faking too much, are being rewarded. To me, there's something inherently wrong with that and the players and teams who employ that strategy should be punished.","neg"
"Its part of the denial of the defeat i think (or just straight up hatred for barcelona). The first penalty was blatant for sure. The second one wasn't but propably looked like it from behind (where the ref was standing) so I can atleast understand why the call was made. The Di Maria one was not a penalty (I think he was down on the ground out of frustration for blowing the chance, not injury)","pos"
"Defending diving.... incredible.   It is outrageous. If the cunt was carded for all good dives he wouldn't be on the pitch. Same with Neymar. ","pos"
"Not necessarily cheating, they aren't breaking any rules. Playing dirty and have a ref call in your favor is the refs fault","pos"
"&gt; Mascherano tackle on Di Maria  I've spent the past 20 minutes trying to find a replay of it with no luck. I'm sure we'll see one in the next few days, but if Suarez and Neymar can get pens for flopping around like fish out of water then surely that was one too.","neg"

Compare this performance to Bayerns first leg 5-1 win over Arsenal. Despite the fact that Bayern and Barca are two different teams facing two completely different oppositions, Bayern absolutely dominated that game and with their play, 5-1 was not the strangest result in the world (albeit a humiliating one for Arsenal). But with PSG coming in with probably their finest game in their club history, they absolutely should have done better. All respect to Barcelona though. Despite that I don't agree with the second penalty, they made the most with what they got and got the result they needed. ","pos"

"I dont know where you guys play soccer but Ive played my whole life and never has the golie been considered as another ""defensive"" player the offense has to get in front of *before* they get the ball passed to them, yes, that also, its not during the pass nor from when pass starts, its actually quite the opposite, its from *before* the pass starts, once the striker foot touches the ball for the pass, the striker has to be able to run ahead of the defense.  Now, regarding the game, you can clearly see the bara player ahead of the defense right before neymar makes the pass, Im not talking about santiago who scored, but one of the other strikers, he was surley ahead","pos"

"The ref helped sooooo much. Dirty play from Suarez, but confusing from the referee. Suarez was getting roughed up all night and that's what he gives a penalty for?  With that being said, astonishing result, and PSG have no one to blame but themselves. ","pos"
"Can we talk about how Suarez definitely dove to get that pen. Like even at the very end when ter stegan came out, he dove to try and get a free kick. It feels like Barcelona won dirty. Anyone else feel this way?","pos"

"I watched a great game but I feel so bad because Barca won :(","pos"
"from /r/all, can someone give context?","pos"
"Pure scum decisions. The second penalty was such a joke, I said at the start of the game Barca will win a penalty to give them a chance at the end. Such a pity as the winner was brilliant","pos"
"2 penalties, 1 own goal and 5+ minutes extra time  my only question is: how much did they pay for this","pos"
"Because it's an aggregate score over 2 matches. PSG won the first 4-0 at home. So had barcelona only won 5-1 it would have been 5-5 overall. In those instances the team with the most goals scored away from home is the winner (eventually goes to penaltys if it's still equal) ","pos"
"The away goals rule. Basically if you score a goal away from home, it counts as a tie-breaker. So if this match had ended 5-1, then the aggregate score would have been 5-5 (PSG won 4-0 at home in the first leg) but PSG would have advanced due to having scored a goal away from home (whereas Barca didn't score in Paris).","pos"
"PSG won the first game 4-0. That means Barcelona would have to equal that in this second game to send it to extra time, win 5-0 to move on or win by 5 goals if PSG score 1 because of the away goals rule. Basically 185 teams have led 4-0 after the first leg and this is the first time in history a team has come back in the second leg to move on ","pos"
"Hello from /r/all!  Can someone explain to a non-soccer watcher how a team could 'blow a 4-0 lead' and then lose 6-1?","pos"
"There are two games played between the teams. The team that advances is based on the combined (aggregate) score between the two games. ","pos"
"The way the tournament works is they play two games each team having 1 home game. In the first game Paris Saint Germaine won 4-0 at home. Then Barcelona at home scored 6 goals and PSG scored 1. The overall final score of the two games was 6-5 but they lost the second game 6-1","pos"
"They had a four-nil advantage from the first leg, conceded thrice, scored once (giving them an away goal, which count double), then conceded thrice more, leaving them a goal down overall. Hope this helps.","pos"
"Can I get some context here? What is meant by a 4 - 0 lead? What does it mean they won by ""aggregate"" 6 - 5?  Thank you.","pos"

"So I got up and open my computer saw 2:0. Been a barca fan, I am like emm we have a chance. Lets see how it goes.  I went to take a shower and prepare my breakfast. Came back and saw the first penalty. 3:0. Ok Now we are really in it.   I think I shall stay back and watch the rest of game before going to work.  After eating my breakfast, it was 3:1. I am like it is over, time to go to work. So I turned off my computer and left.  Got to work and saw 6:1.  WTF. This is just beyond amazing. This is crazy. ...","pos"

"Fixed or naw?","pos"
"I just woke up, watched the GIF, and thought to myself...  WTF? They're up 5-1, in extra time, and not only are they trying to still score another goal but they're celebrating like crazy? Serious lack of sportsmanship...   Then I went back and saw 5-5 and now I get it.  I really get it.   I'm a Toronto Maple Leafs fan.   http://nesn.com/playlist/toronto-maple-leafs-five-biggest-collapses/1/  As the 8th seed a few years ago facing the #1 seed in the playoffs and a bitter rival in the Boston Bruins, we're in game 7 with 15 minutes left, up 4-1, and they come back, tie it, and then win it in overtime somehow someway.   Unbeliefable.","pos"

"I'm waking up and I hate Barcelona even more. What a piss start of the day. Neymar, Suarez and the referee befriended each other on Twitter. Congratulated each other for a job well done and that they made the evening easy for each other.","pos"
"I don't even like football anymore","pos"
"1 wrong penalty and 1 questionable, how is this the greatest game you have watched?","neg"
"Agreed, entertaining sure, but the greatest, wtf ? It was a shit show","pos"
"How could you say this was the greatest game if Barca literally got 2 penalties for diving. Also worth mentioning that in my opinion PSG should have gotten a penalty when Mascherano blocked a cross. I mean it is a great comeback, but if the referee did his job right, PSG would have went through. ","pos"
"Never gonna forget that","pos"
"We are all Barcelonan on this blessed day.","pos"
"Nah you can't be telling me that PSG didn't get robbed I have nothing against Barca and they were exceptional but Barca got some really soft calls in their favor and PSG deserved a penalty and the penalty call that Neymar got when Meunier slipped into him was defo not a penalty. ","pos"

"For someone who doesn't watch much soccer, why is winning by 5 such a big deal?","pos"
"As much as I hate the fact the game turned on Saurez's dive - and not even a very good one - it was really interesting how Neymar really stepped up in those last 15 minutes. He was the best player on the pitch by a mile, and it was interesting the Barca players seemed to turn to him to do something, rather than Messi.  Still a sickener that Saurez wasn't sent off for that second dive. That would have been interesting.","pos"
"PSG was playing against 12 players. They had no chance.","pos"
"I'm a hardcore Real fan (since R. Carlos, Zidane, Figo, Guti, Raul etc.) but this was one of those games I enjoyed despite Barca winning. This game I'll never forget, like I'll never forget pass from Modri to Ramos vs Atletico, Bayern vs Man Utd., Liverpool vs Milan etc.","pos"
"Did we just crush the Soccer sub?","pos"
"To /r/all PSG basically did what the Falcons did at the superbowl. They blew the lead and Barcelona won 6-5 from being 4-0 down in the first leg (series) of the game.","pos"
