"It's different Barca came out flat and got destroyed, they believed in themselves to come back from a 4-0 deficit and came out fighting.  PSG just had to hold Barca to less than 4 and came out playing scared with no fight in them or any will to win and got destroyed.","pos"

"I am Barca fan but surprisingly after watching three different post game studios, every single ""pro"" has thought that it was tight situation but after all the defender lift his hand to Suarez's line and even with very minimal contact that would not be wrong to give the penalty. Now im not giving my opinion but purely what thease commentators/pundits said.  I think that Suarez made himself to look stupid with the way he went down, but as of right now IM SUPER HAPPY!","pos"

"Hello people from r/all. Here's a description about the importance of the goal. There's a tournament called the Champions League, where the best teams in Europe play at this stage of the tournament. There are always 2 games between those teams, where one team plays at home and away. Now, the first time they played, Barcelona lost 4-0 to PSG. Everyone thought it was over. There has been 0 teams in the history coming back from such a deficit. No one was really expecting anything, but as the game started, Barcelona scored an early goal. During first half time, Barcelona were leading 2-0 (still 2 goals away). Then, at second half, Barcelona scored another early goal making it 3-0. Now they are 1 goal away. There's about 40 minutes left to play and everyone got hyped up and were looking at an historical moment, atleast for a start. As the hype built up, Barcelona conceded a goal making it 3-1. This means Barcelona must win with atleast 6 goals. This 3-1 scoreline was within the last 20 minutes of the game, and the hype that was built up, was soon vanished. I mean, who can score 3 goals in 20 minutes against a top tier team? Anyway, as the game went on, Barcelona scored 4-1. Everyone was like, meh, a goal that doesn't mean much. Then 5-1 came, with a few more minutes to play. Then the unbelievable happened and they actually turned it around, and the goal in the video is the last goal they needed to advance and qualify, and it really happened. All in all, no one expected a advancement from Barcelona. But as they took the lead early on, everyone was building up hype and soon came the counter goal and the hype was dead until they turned it around by 3 magical last minute goals.   By /u/sutro19  ","pos"
"Suarez did overreacted but there was contact.Its not his fault that he dived because refs do not see contact many times and dont give fouls unless you go down. Its best example was seen in Man City vs Spurs were City were denied a clear penalty for foul on Sterling because he did not go to ground","pos"

"Yes you correct changed it - When I was typing out Wednesday night didn't seem correct at the time.","pos"

"On paper this result looks godlike, but the first ((penalty)) FCB got &amp; the penalty PSG did not get (fault on Di Maria) makes this result unbelievable, not in a good sense.  However, PSG made the arrogant mistake of only defending in the first half against Barcelona, where they should have gone full force for a goal and demoralize FCB from the start. ","pos"

"As a person that is coming from all, why is it a big deal that a team won 6-1 vs 5-1? ","pos"
"PSG won the first leg with 4-0 at home. This means that Barca ould have needed a 4-0 as well to go into over time, or a 5-0 to proceed into the next round directly.  PSG scored one goal though. You would think that that means that Barcelona need a 5-1 to go into overtime (making it a 5-5 aggregate), but in soccer there is an away goal rule, in which an away goal is weighed heavier than a home goal, meaning that in case of a 5-5 aggregate, PSG proceeds directly. There can be no extra time.   So, to proceed, Barca needed a 6-1 win, and they did it, going from 3-1 to 6-1 within seven minutes or so.  This is incredible. ","pos"
"Correct, they win 6-5 on aggregate.  What's even more incredible, is they also overturned an away-goal advantage.","pos"

"So the NBA had the Cavs historic comeback. The 73-9 Warriors (best in-season team of all time) blew a 3-1 lead in the finals.  Then the MLB had the Cubs historic comeback. The Indians (being from Cleveland it hurts to say this) blew a 3-1 lead. And the Cubs ALMOST lost that game on what would have been the greatest single-game comeback in World Series history.   Then in tennis we somehow we had another showdown between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in a finals match. Something no one thought we'd see again.   Days later the NFL had the Patriots' historic 25 point comeback to beat the Atlanta Falcons.   And now, still within a year from the Cavs upset of Golden State, we have this Champions League upset.  Has this much drama ever happened in a single year of sports?","pos"
