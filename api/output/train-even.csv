"Time for a story.  You may have seen the Nike 'Switch' advert with Cristiano Ronaldo. The eagle eyed among you may have realised that the Charlton Preston game was filmed at Rotherham's New York Stadium. I was a member of the crowd for that game, in fact they also filmed some of the other games there too. This included the England Portugal game.  In the advert you see Harry Kane score in that game and on the day they had, unsurprisingly, a Harry Kane look-a-like. Once everyone was in place the cameras roll. Ball comes to our hero/Cristiano Ronaldo who deftly knocks it to Kane who...skys it! The crowd respond with 'oohs' and hold their heads. To our surprise Kane and others were celebrating. Of course! The ball doesn't need to go in the back of the net, this isn't real life. After a breif telling off by the director we go again, same move and... Kane pulls it wide! We erupt, cheering jumping up and down, the whole works. Take three... Kane misses - the crowd goes wild. And again. And again. I don't know how many times we did this. I started feeling sorry for this guy. We'd got into crowd mindset and the pisstaking echoed around the all but empty stadium. Finally the director calls 'one last take' and we go again the touch to Kane, he shoots and the back of the net ripples! Fuck me he's actually scored! For the first time that day we genuinely cheer, strangers hugging one another, it was a beautiful thing.  Looking back now it makes wonder if it actually was a look-a-like, but it must have been. This guy actually managed to score.",neg

It's a big problem, regardless of whether or not it's commonplace or good strategy. Neymar and Suarez were doing it all game and it certainly paid dividends for the team, which is exactly why people are outraged. Maybe PSG needs to get their shit together and not allow so many goals, but those two penalties were the total difference in the game and both were won by players that spent the entire match flopping around.",neg

"I'm guessing they want this bc the club gets more revenue by being in the top league. The issue though is that if they are exempt and end the season in one of the relegation slots, a team above them will get relegated instead, which will piss them off (for a good reason too). If this occurs, you also have to worry about the quality of the league diminishing due to keeping a team that shouldn't be there.   I think it's great that other teams and groups are trying to help and support this team during a time of tragedy, but these are some implications that I hadn't seen anyone else talk about yet.",neg

"To the people from the frontpage, who came here without any idea what is going on:  This  thread is about football. Not your american football, but the *real* football. This was the second leg of the Round of 16 between Paris Saint German and FC Barcelona in the Champions League. In the first leg Paris won 4-0 and beat the favorites by a huge margin.   There is a special rule about away goals in Football cups like the Champions League. If both legs end with the same goal difference - e g. 2:0 and 1:3, then the team with more away goals reaches the next round. This was the case in the second leg. Paris scored the important away goal, so a 5:1 for Barcelona wouldn't be enough to qualify for the quarter finals. So they needed 6 (!) goals, which was more or less impossible.  In the 88th minute the score was 3:1. So there were only 2 minutes left + 5 minutes of injury time. Barcelona managed to do the impossible and score 3 goals in the last minutes. This video is the last goal in the 90+5th minute of the game, literally the last chance of the match. This match is comparable with the last super bowl match with the Patriots. Unbelievable.",neg
"Fuck the Aubameyang, can we have this guy please?",neg

He was the best player on the pitch by a mile, and it was interesting the Barca players seemed to turn to him to do something, rather than Messi.  Still a sickener that Saurez wasn't sent off for that second dive. That would have been interesting.",pos

"He had a few of those great games at the tail end of LVG's first season, when we made that push for top 4.   He and Ashley Young had a good partnership in the left side of the midfield. Fellaini would make a surging diagonal run into the box and Young would deliver him a perfect cross, from there Fellaini would either chest it down and setup a teammate OR he would head it into the back of the net.   It added a direct dimension to our attack and contrast nicely with the more intricate Herrera/Mata link up on the right side.",pos

"Based on my limited knowledge, teams sometimes have insurance on playing contracts (I.e. Career ending injuries) to protect against salary. However, I think that's nullified in this case since the player is dead, the contract would end already (performance contracts would not carryover to estates).    Team could have travel insurance like we would against trip cancellation, etc. So I guess that protects them from the hotel and travel fees that they might have arranged before hand. Minor in the grand scheme of things.  Players could have life insurance, but that doesn't impact the team.    In terms of the value of the player to the team, I don't know and have never heard of insurance for that. It's people talent, not a tangible asset.  However, the club could potentially sue the airline for damages down the road.",pos

"The problem is Rafa did a good job, but not a fantastic job.  I know people would say ""who cares,"" but I still wanted the League Cup and Club World Cup, they were still trophies to won.  More importantly, he was minutes away from a disaster in the league.  Chelsea were down 1-0 to Villa with 30 minutes remaining, which would've put them out of the Champions League.

Now, regarding the game, you can clearly see the bara player ahead of the defense right before neymar makes the pass, Im not talking about santiago who scored, but one of the other strikers, he was surley ahead",pos

"Statement:  I have been reflecting deeply about my presidency and about the forty years in which my life has been inextricably bound to FIFA and the great sport of football. I cherish FIFA more than anything and I want to do only what is best for FIFA and for football. I felt compelled to stand for re-election, as I believed that this was the best thing for the organisation. That election is over but FIFAs challenges are not. FIFA needs a profound overhaul. While I have a mandate from the membership of FIFA, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football  the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe and love football as much as we all do at FIFA.  Therefore, I have decided to lay down my mandate at an extraordinary elective Congress. I will continue to exercise my functions as FIFA President until that election. The next ordinary FIFA Congress will take place on 13 May 2016 in Mexico City. This would create unnecessary delay and I will urge the Executive Committee to organise an Extraordinary Congress for the election of my successor at the earliest opportunity. This will need to be done in line with FIFAs statutes and we must allow enough time for the best candidates to present themselves and to campaign.  Since I shall not be a candidate, and am therefore now free from the constraints that elections inevitably impose, I shall be able to focus on driving far-reaching, fundamental reforms that transcend our previous efforts. For years, we have worked hard to put in place administrative reforms, but it is plain to me that while these must continue, they are not enough. The Executive Committee includes representatives of confederations over whom we have no control, but for whose actions FIFA is held responsible. We need deep-rooted structural change. The size of the Executive Committee must be reduced and its members should be elected through the FIFA Congress. The integrity checks for all Executive Committee members must be organised centrally through FIFA and not through the confederations. We need term limits not only for the president but for all members of the Executive Committee. I have fought for these changes before and, as everyone knows, my efforts have been blocked. This time, I will succeed.  I cannot do this alone. I have asked Domenico Scala to oversee the introduction and implementation of these and other measures. Mr. Scala is the Independent Chairman of our Audit and Compliance Committee elected by the FIFA Congress. He is also the Chairman of the ad hoc Electoral Committee and, as such, he will oversee the election of my successor. Mr. Scala enjoys the confidence of a wide range of constituents within and outside of FIFA and has all the knowledge and experience necessary to help tackle these major reforms. It is my deep care for FIFA and its interests, which I hold very dear, that has led me to take this decision. I would like to thank those who have always supported me in a constructive and loyal manner as President of FIFA and who have done so much for the game that we all love. What matters to me more than anything is that when all of this is over, football is the winner.",pos

Not only that, Chapecoense (BRA) is the finals vs Atltico Nacional (COL) in Copa Sudamericana (Sudamericana is to Libertadores what Europa League is to Champions League), which is why they were flying there in the first place.  What Chapecoense managed to do, **and I'm not saying it because of the accident**, was incredible. It's **REALLY** hard to maintain a team in any A series in the world if your fanbase is not that big, compared to all the ""big"" teams. The smaller you are, the less money you get from everything (and everyone) and the harder it is to build a competitive team on a low budget.  They are one of the few teams in Brazil that don't have shady stuff going around them and no corrupt in their management staff.

"Since I am a Liverpool supporter from the USA and I have seen on various occasions supporters of many English clubs complain about the atmosphere at matches as of late. I'd like to give my opinion as someone with virtually no atmosphere at the sporting events I go to. I see lots of people say that football is becoming commercial, and it is, but compared to how we have it in America, its no where near commercial yet. Here, an American Football game is upwards of 4 hours because of commercials, and at Professional games, you barely chant at all. You go and sit and cheer when your team does something good. But You get odd looks when you chant, when you yell encouragement at the players. Everything about professional sports here is sterile. Everything. So when I started to support Liverpool 3 or 4 years ago, I fell in love with the club and the sport of football because of the passion. I don't get to experience it in America, and it was just so fascinating and enticing to see people who saw themselves as supporters first. So when I watch Liverpool games, United games, any of the top English teams, and I no longer see the atmosphere, it breaks my heart. Because that passion is what made me love football. That atmosphere is why I spend my Saturdays or Sundays at a bar, with some strangers, singing for my Reds. Because deep down in its roots, football is the fans. Its not about the money (even though China thinks it is). Its not about the silverware. Its about the fans, who come to sing and cheer on the players. So if the atmosphere goes, then the sport goes with it and becomes another bland, sterile form of entertainment like every sport we play over here. Because as they say, football with out fans, truly is nothing.",pos
