Third, it looks like there is less people because when it rains people who are in the not covered parts go to the most deep zone which is covered by the higher harrow.  Fourth, the team hasn't been playing that well lately so people is less likely to fight against all this incoveniences to watch a match.

"To be honest, Real is the one who's been scoring all the clutch goals.

It's the same story as Barca in a nutshell: when they are on, they are on. But Real has been saved by last minute clutch goals so much this season. It really inflates how well they are perceived to be doing. I'd put Juventus above them if I was a betting man for the UCL title.",pos

"Said before the tournament Rooney's not good enough for the starting 11, and everyone knew that Roy has no tactics.  It's time for some reflection, regrouping and a fresh start for England. Rooney has to go, not a captain, doesn't lead by example and can't even hold his hands up for his obvious drop in ability. At least Hart admitted there's two goals he should be saving.   We need a bold, younger manager who can connect with this young group (like we've seen Poch and less so Southgate with the u21) and find a way to motivate and develop a system that works for the young lads.  Watching this game and England in general in this tournament has been like watching a really shit Man Utd, somewhere between Moyes and early Van Gaal. Honestly think Roy just told them ""Right lads on the wings cross it in, hope for the best""  We have creative players (i.e. Alli, Barkley, Lallana) who can run at defences commit players and cause problems. What did Roy do to them. Honestly worried they'll be mentally scarred for life. What happened to England playing a number 10, like an actual CAM. We've seen glimpses from Sterling, Barkley, Alli, Lallana there to great effect. Yet somehow it's been reduced to hoping our wing backs can win the game..   Cannot bring myself to watch the highlights of this game and don't think I ever will. So much talent, so much wasted opportunity. Even as a liverpool fan I longed to see the physical presence of Barkley learning the CAM role, running at defences. I was looking forward to a slightly rejuvenated Sturridge putting his mark down as our most talented striker, coming close to his prime being utilised. But wait where is he? Oh of course out on the right wing where he was playing, oh yeah back when he was a kid at Chelsea. If you don't play your best players in their best position, you're not going to get the best from them. After the Germany game, we needed tweaks, we looked better without Waz. But no, backwards and downwards and to the wingbacks and out for corners and into the stands and into the abyss of historically depressing England results. Wayne Rooney, aka the new the Scholes, what an absolute joke. He's not Scholes, he's not Pirlo, he's not Gerrard, he's an unfit blobby shade of his former self that will never play at a higher level again. I'd say none of them are fit to wear the shirt but we genuinely have some good young talent. Which makes it all the more painful.  Roy Hodgson and Gary Neville, is that the best you can do FA? Seriously.. 1 WIN IN 2 TOURNAMENTS. Let that sink in. real deep. like really deep. Then remember we beat Germany pre-tournament without Rooney.  Looking forward to a Belgium v France/Italy final. May the best team win. Iceland you've humiliated us, congrats, hope you get demolished next round.",pos

"I'm 16 years old, my entire group of friends follows soccer and we all have our teams and our rivalries and we pick on each other but at the end of the day we all still love the beautiful game. I have been putting money away and saving for a while and I want to travel to England one day to watch a game. Not because I would get good pictures or take selfies with whomever but because I want to watch the club that I love. I spend my days thinking about soccer. The first half of the week I'm thinking about and discussing the last game and for the second half I think about and discuss the upcoming game. It can be so hard to discuss this with people from Europe because they all take me as a fan who stupidly and randomly picked to support Liverpool ( which in fact I didn't) and only cares about when they when. This just isn't true I have more passion for the club than some actual fans who go to games and just leave when they are losing. I can't even wrap my head around that, your team needs you most when you are losing and that's how you respond, by leaving? It's ludicrous to me it actually is and I can't even fathom that. When I go to England in two years time, I don't care who Liverpool is playing, whether they are winning or losing or if it is an important match, I will be giving it my all to support the players and be a real fan and not someone who shows up for likes on Facebook. I'll sing my voice out a and honestly I sometimes almost come to tears when I hear you'll never walk alone ( particularly after the chapeconese accident). I stick with my team through the losses and wins and whatever is in between. So please people of Europe and Reddit, understand that just because I don't have the money to go to games and just because I'm from America doesn't mean I don't support clubs just as those who are in better scenarios do, and people who go to games, please don't ever leave and please always support even when losing because that's when they need you the most, I can't go and support for a while so I hope this influences some people that go to the Liverpool games or whatever team you support for that matter, to stick around and support, really support and give it your all. I give it my all to my local club even when they lose and when they win and when they need it and don't because I care, I really care about them and the players and their lives and the fans and the coaches and the staff and the club",pos

"My inner conspiracist is screaming that this is an organized move from FIFA to buy time or something. maybe they think that if they show the public - which has spoken quite a bit against the 2022 Qatar World Cup - that they are listening to them. So, they arrest the Warner and Figueredo (men that have have shown corruption, but maybe not large scale and a truly fundamental part of the 'executive committee') and they will be charged in the US - if they do. But these arrests are just an act to appease public interest without having to properly change and rectify the issue that FIFA has been and, even more so now, become.  Or, maybe not, ya kno?",pos

Fellaini would make a surging diagonal run into the box and Young would deliver him a perfect cross, from there Fellaini would either chest it down and setup a teammate OR he would head it into the back of the net.   It added a direct dimension to our attack and contrast nicely with the more intricate Herrera/Mata link up on the right side.",pos

"Based on my limited knowledge, teams sometimes have insurance on playing contracts (I.e. Career ending injuries) to protect against salary. However, I think that's nullified in this case since the player is dead, the contract would end already (performance contracts would not carryover to estates).    Team could have travel insurance like we would against trip cancellation, etc. So I guess that protects them from the hotel and travel fees that they might have arranged before hand. Minor in the grand scheme of things.  Players could have life insurance, but that doesn't impact the team.    In terms of the value of the player to the team, I don't know and have never heard of insurance for that. It's people talent, not a tangible asset.  However, the club could potentially sue the airline for damages down the road.",pos

More importantly, he was minutes away from a disaster in the league.  Chelsea were down 1-0 to Villa with 30 minutes remaining, which would've put them out of the Champions League.

Now, regarding the game, you can clearly see the bara player ahead of the defense right before neymar makes the pass, Im not talking about santiago who scored, but one of the other strikers, he was surley ahead",pos

"Statement:  I have been reflecting deeply about my presidency and about the forty years in which my life has been inextricably bound to FIFA and the great sport of football. I cherish FIFA more than anything and I want to do only what is best for FIFA and for football. I felt compelled to stand for re-election, as I believed that this was the best thing for the organisation. That election is over but FIFAs challenges are not. FIFA needs a profound overhaul. While I have a mandate from the membership of FIFA, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football  the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe and love football as much as we all do at FIFA.  Therefore, I have decided to lay down my mandate at an extraordinary elective Congress. I will continue to exercise my functions as FIFA President until that election. The next ordinary FIFA Congress will take place on 13 May 2016 in Mexico City. This would create unnecessary delay and I will urge the Executive Committee to organise an Extraordinary Congress for the election of my successor at the earliest opportunity. This will need to be done in line with FIFAs statutes and we must allow enough time for the best candidates to present themselves and to campaign.  Since I shall not be a candidate, and am therefore now free from the constraints that elections inevitably impose, I shall be able to focus on driving far-reaching, fundamental reforms that transcend our previous efforts. For years, we have worked hard to put in place administrative reforms, but it is plain to me that while these must continue, they are not enough. The Executive Committee includes representatives of confederations over whom we have no control, but for whose actions FIFA is held responsible. We need deep-rooted structural change. The size of the Executive Committee must be reduced and its members should be elected through the FIFA Congress. The integrity checks for all Executive Committee members must be organised centrally through FIFA and not through the confederations. We need term limits not only for the president but for all members of the Executive Committee. I have fought for these changes before and, as everyone knows, my efforts have been blocked. This time, I will succeed.  I cannot do this alone. I have asked Domenico Scala to oversee the introduction and implementation of these and other measures. Mr. Scala is the Independent Chairman of our Audit and Compliance Committee elected by the FIFA Congress. He is also the Chairman of the ad hoc Electoral Committee and, as such, he will oversee the election of my successor. Mr. Scala enjoys the confidence of a wide range of constituents within and outside of FIFA and has all the knowledge and experience necessary to help tackle these major reforms. It is my deep care for FIFA and its interests, which I hold very dear, that has led me to take this decision. I would like to thank those who have always supported me in a constructive and loyal manner as President of FIFA and who have done so much for the game that we all love. What matters to me more than anything is that when all of this is over, football is the winner.",pos

"Of course this tragedy would be sad if it happened to any other club as well, but Chapecoense was a rolemodel team.  They got their access to Brazilian ""Srie A"" in 2013 for the first time, avoided relegations finishing 15th place in 2014, finished 14th in 2015 and is right now 9th place in 2016, with 1 match away from ending 2016's Srie A.   Not only that, Chapecoense (BRA) is the finals vs Atltico Nacional (COL) in Copa Sudamericana (Sudamericana is to Libertadores what Europa League is to Champions League), which is why they were flying there in the first place.  What Chapecoense managed to do, **and I'm not saying it because of the accident**, was incredible. It's **REALLY** hard to maintain a team in any A series in the world if your fanbase is not that big, compared to all the ""big"" teams. The smaller you are, the less money you get from everything (and everyone) and the harder it is to build a competitive team on a low budget.  They are one of the few teams in Brazil that don't have shady stuff going around them and no corrupt in their management staff.

"Since I am a Liverpool supporter from the USA and I have seen on various occasions supporters of many English clubs complain about the atmosphere at matches as of late. I'd like to give my opinion as someone with virtually no atmosphere at the sporting events I go to. I see lots of people say that football is becoming commercial, and it is, but compared to how we have it in America, its no where near commercial yet. Here, an American Football game is upwards of 4 hours because of commercials, and at Professional games, you barely chant at all. You go and sit and cheer when your team does something good. But You get odd looks when you chant, when you yell encouragement at the players. Everything about professional sports here is sterile. Everything. So when I started to support Liverpool 3 or 4 years ago, I fell in love with the club and the sport of football because of the passion. I don't get to experience it in America, and it was just so fascinating and enticing to see people who saw themselves as supporters first. So when I watch Liverpool games, United games, any of the top English teams, and I no longer see the atmosphere, it breaks my heart. Because that passion is what made me love football. That atmosphere is why I spend my Saturdays or Sundays at a bar, with some strangers, singing for my Reds. Because deep down in its roots, football is the fans. Its not about the money (even though China thinks it is). Its not about the silverware. Its about the fans, who come to sing and cheer on the players. So if the atmosphere goes, then the sport goes with it and becomes another bland, sterile form of entertainment like every sport we play over here. Because as they say, football with out fans, truly is nothing.",pos
This made me choke on my beer. Well played sir.,pos
So maybe we should call it football now ?,pos
Commenting to commemorate this historic day and thread. Unbelievable.,pos

"Honestly, I cannot fathom how people who watch both play each week can say they are comparable. Ronaldo is an unbelievably good player, among the great names in history for sure. But then you have Messi, who is not just a godlike poacher but is also a creative and positional genius, so complete at a level unimaginable... It just sucks for CR to play in the same era as this little guy.",pos

"You're the one missing the point mate.   If you want to combine the total of /r/NFL and /r/CFB two American Football related subs.   You'd have to do the same for Football related subs, such as /r/bundesliga /r/futbol etc.    If you honestly can't understand that concept i dont know what to tell you :/",pos
That was an incredible buildup and strike and a decent keeper would have saved it.,pos

"Yeah if I were the referee and it were 0-0 or maybe even 1-0, I just might call it offside, but it's 2-0 in the 85'th. Who am I to deny him that goal.",pos

"That's actually played a lot in Germany.  There are lot of hobby tournaments, where drinking seems to be more important than playing. Teams give themselves names with Alkohol in it, like FC Vodka Burghausen.   Some of my friends in High School had one, and they did fairly well. With drinking and with playing.",pos
The fuck ? No it was going so well !,pos
