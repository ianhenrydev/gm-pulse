Compare this performance to Bayerns first leg 5-1 win over Arsenal. Despite the fact that Bayern and Barca are two different teams facing two completely different oppositions, Bayern absolutely dominated that game and with their play, 5-1 was not the strangest result in the world (albeit a humiliating one for Arsenal). But with PSG coming in with probably their finest game in their club history, they absolutely should have done better. All respect to Barcelona though. Despite that I don't agree with the second penalty, they made the most with what they got and got the result they needed. ","pos"

"I watched a great game but I feel so bad because Barca won :(","pos"
"from /r/all, can someone give context?","pos"
"PSG won the first leg with 4-0 at home. This means that Barca ould have needed a 4-0 as well to go into over time, or a 5-0 to proceed into the next round directly.  PSG scored one goal though. You would think that that means that Barcelona need a 5-1 to go into overtime (making it a 5-5 aggregate), but in soccer there is an away goal rule, in which an away goal is weighed heavier than a home goal, meaning that in case of a 5-5 aggregate, PSG proceeds directly. There can be no extra time.   So, to proceed, Barca needed a 6-1 win, and they did it, going from 3-1 to 6-1 within seven minutes or so.  This is incredible. ","pos"
"PSG won the first game 4-0. That means Barcelona would have to equal that in this second game to send it to extra time, win 5-0 to move on or win by 5 goals if PSG score 1 because of the away goals rule. Basically 185 teams have led 4-0 after the first leg and this is the first time in history a team has come back in the second leg to move on ","pos"

Serious lack of sportsmanship...   Then I went back and saw 5-5 and now I get it.  I really get it.   I'm a Toronto Maple Leafs fan.   http://nesn.com/playlist/toronto-maple-leafs-five-biggest-collapses/1/  As the 8th seed a few years ago facing the #1 seed in the playoffs and a bitter rival in the Boston Bruins, we're in game 7 with 15 minutes left, up 4-1, and they come back, tie it, and then win it in overtime somehow someway.

He was slinging his foot up trying to make something happen in the box. Give the guy 1000 chances to recreate that goal, and he couldn't. By that undeniable fact, it's a lucky goal. Still sweet, but incredibly lucky.   Idk, it could be that I'm biased, but seeing these types of goals don't impress me as much as something like this: https://streamable.com/0aqy8. How Messi wraps the ball around the outside of his foot at the 57 sec mark is more impressive to me than Giroud's scorpion kick.

"Here from r/all. Know nothing about soccer. How does someone win when it's a tie? A points system I assume? Thanks","neg"
"This idea that the most points on the board is directly equal to playing the best football is nonsense. Leicester were better at winning games. That doesn't mean playing good football to do it. Just 2 games ago Leicester were in a rut of 1-0 wins that they scraped after teams couldn't stick the ball into an open goal from 6 yards out.  But then, there's a lot of opinion in football. Unfortunately only some of those are from people that actually watched the games they're talking about. I'm not begrudging Leicester for those ropey performances either. They knew how to grind out games which is a great asset for a football team to have. Does grinding out games = great football? Ask everybody watching Chelsea last year. If you don't wanna go back and watch, every single stat apart from the points on the board indicate the football from the Spurs lot was the best this year. Or you could listen to one of the many managers that came out and said how we're the best team they played.   &gt; Oh, whining and bitching, are we?  As a black guy who's watched football for 15 years of the 22 I've been about, I'd like to get to the point where racist footballers are banned, and not just given the slap on the wrist we've come to accept. I've seen absolutely zero progress since I've been following football. Yeah, fair enough Leicester have won the league, but I'll NEVER let anybody forget a racist. I don't give a fuck how good a footballer he is and it's disgusting that such a player should be awarded the WRITER'S award. The same **WRITERS** that ran the reports about his remarks in the first place.  Pointing out the hypocrisy in football support and racism is ""whining and bitching"". What a fucking world we live in.","pos"

"From an American perspective, how I've tried to explain why the miraculous Leicester season is once-in-a-lifetime to my non-soccer friends: In American sports leagues - MLB, NBA, etc. - the playoffs serve as a nice buffer, in a way. A 'bad' team like the 76ers does not have to be the best in the league during the regular season; in fact, they only need to be one of the eight best in their conference (16 of the 30 teams make the playoffs). Sure, if they went through the playoffs and won the NBA finals, it would absolutely be a huge underdog story, but we all know the adage that anything can happen come playoff-time. Often, playoffs are decided simply by who has a hot or cold streak of form. The Premier League doesn't have playoffs at the end of the season. Leicester City will have had 38 grueling games in a very competitive league, and by the end of it, they will (presumably) be on top. They don't have the luxury of just being one of the x best teams, having a chance to regroup before the playoffs, and then going on a great run to win the title. This team has, over the course of about 13 months, gone from the worst team in the league to the best, and a 38-game season with no playoffs tells me that their rise hasn't been a fluke. Really, only Montpellier and Kaiserslautern can even slightly compare in terms of magnitude, and even then, Leicester being 20th for much of last season gives them the edge in terms of in my opinion.","pos"
