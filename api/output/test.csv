"To the people from the frontpage, who came here without any idea what is going on:  This  thread is about football. Not your american football, but the *real* football. This was the second leg of the Round of 16 between Paris Saint German and FC Barcelona in the Champions League. In the first leg Paris won 4-0 and beat the favorites by a huge margin.   There is a special rule about away goals in Football cups like the Champions League. If both legs end with the same goal difference - e g. 2:0 and 1:3, then the team with more away goals reaches the next round. This was the case in the second leg. Paris scored the important away goal, so a 5:1 for Barcelona wouldn't be enough to qualify for the quarter finals. So they needed 6 (!) goals, which was more or less impossible.  In the 88th minute the score was 3:1. So there were only 2 minutes left + 5 minutes of injury time. Barcelona managed to do the impossible and score 3 goals in the last minutes. This video is the last goal in the 90+5th minute of the game, literally the last chance of the match. This match is comparable with the last super bowl match with the Patriots. Unbelievable.

"What a joke. Blatant dive by a player already on yellow for diving.","pos"
"That doesn't make it any less of a joke, Suarez was already playing on a yellow for simulation and this was more of the same. It's a big problem, regardless of whether or not it's commonplace or good strategy. Neymar and Suarez were doing it all game and it certainly paid dividends for the team, which is exactly why people are outraged. Maybe PSG needs to get their shit together and not allow so many goals, but those two penalties were the total difference in the game and both were won by players that spent the entire match flopping around.","neg"
"I'm not in here arguing that it isn't the winning strategy, but I think it's obvious from the di Maria tackle just a few minutes earlier that PSG either wasn't intent on flopping around or that the refs weren't going to call it for them.  Given the rules of the game Suarez et. al. are clearly doing whatever they can to win the game and they can hardly be faulted, but the fact that it's winning strategy to play outside of the spirit/intent of the game is what's so frustrating to watch as a fan. Teams that are willing to go all out, to the extent where their players are sent off for faking too much, are being rewarded. To me, there's something inherently wrong with that and the players and teams who employ that strategy should be punished.","neg"

Compare this performance to Bayerns first leg 5-1 win over Arsenal. Despite the fact that Bayern and Barca are two different teams facing two completely different oppositions, Bayern absolutely dominated that game and with their play, 5-1 was not the strangest result in the world (albeit a humiliating one for Arsenal). But with PSG coming in with probably their finest game in their club history, they absolutely should have done better. All respect to Barcelona though.

They dominated every game they played except this Iceland Game. Also Iceland packs a bus, and its extremely difficult to break these blocks down without quick movement and quality.   Compared to the quality of previous english teams, you can say this was a decent attempt. Most of the players are young and its their first tournament. I was only pissed that Hodgson didn't pick his squad on merit but on loyalty, and that ultimately cost him his job. Sterling, Rooney, Wilshere, should not have been in the squad based on their seasons. Noble, Defoe, Townsend all had great seasons. Drinkwater had a decent season but only converted to a midfielder late in the season, so I can understand not being called up. All in All. It's a decent start.  It's only up from here.","pos"

Smalling and Cahill aren't, and have never been, good enough for England. Hart again bottled it. Sturridge was poor but was played out of position, Sterling was rubbish, he was lucky with the penalty being as he'd lost the ball and their keeper lost his head. Rose, Dier and Walker offered nothing.   Gary Neville is clearly not a good defensive coach. You can't keep making the same defensive mistakes defending throw-ins. Hodgson shouldn't be bringing our last sub on with 5 minutes to go. Rooney should have gone at half time, 60 minutes at most. Vardy should have started as Kane's been nowhere all tournament.

"Said before the tournament Rooney's not good enough for the starting 11, and everyone knew that Roy has no tactics.  It's time for some reflection, regrouping and a fresh start for England. Rooney has to go, not a captain, doesn't lead by example and can't even hold his hands up for his obvious drop in ability. At least Hart admitted there's two goals he should be saving.   We need a bold, younger manager who can connect with this young group (like we've seen Poch and less so Southgate with the u21) and find a way to motivate and develop a system that works for the young lads.  Watching this game and England in general in this tournament has been like watching a really shit Man Utd, somewhere between Moyes and early Van Gaal. Honestly think Roy just told them ""Right lads on the wings cross it in, hope for the best""  We have creative players (i.e. Alli, Barkley, Lallana) who can run at defences commit players and cause problems. What did Roy do to them. Honestly worried they'll be mentally scarred for life. What happened to England playing a number 10, like an actual CAM. We've seen glimpses from Sterling, Barkley, Alli, Lallana there to great effect. Yet somehow it's been reduced to hoping our wing backs can win the game..   Cannot bring myself to watch the highlights of this game and don't think I ever will. So much talent, so much wasted opportunity. Even as a liverpool fan I longed to see the physical presence of Barkley learning the CAM role, running at defences. I was looking forward to a slightly rejuvenated Sturridge putting his mark down as our most talented striker, coming close to his prime being utilised. But wait where is he? Oh of course out on the right wing where he was playing, oh yeah back when he was a kid at Chelsea. If you don't play your best players in their best position, you're not going to get the best from them. After the Germany game, we needed tweaks, we looked better without Waz. But no, backwards and downwards and to the wingbacks and out for corners and into the stands and into the abyss of historically depressing England results. Wayne Rooney, aka the new the Scholes, what an absolute joke. He's not Scholes, he's not Pirlo, he's not Gerrard, he's an unfit blobby shade of his former self that will never play at a higher level again. I'd say none of them are fit to wear the shirt but we genuinely have some good young talent. Which makes it all the more painful.  Roy Hodgson and Gary Neville, is that the best you can do FA? Seriously.. 1 WIN IN 2 TOURNAMENTS. Let that sink in. real deep. like really deep. Then remember we beat Germany pre-tournament without Rooney.  Looking forward to a Belgium v France/Italy final. May the best team win. Iceland you've humiliated us, congrats, hope you get demolished next round.","pos"
"From an outside American perspective England's 'supporters' at the game were as poor as the players  in the second half. I don't care if they were losing to a country smaller than most average American cities... They seemed to accept the result, provided zero noise or energy to motivate a comeback, and instead booed every single mistake an English player made... Not exactly the best way to 'support' your country and feed energy to the players. Sure the players didn't have their best games and people were frustrated, but voice those frustrations after the game. Things like this contribute to the poor state of England's national team and the culture surrounding the program that have made them underachievers for decades. If I were English I would be VERY concerned about the culture surrounding the national team, at least the usmnt's disappoints are due to clear gaps in quality... England's is much deeper than that  ","pos"

"The guy is one of the biggest frauds around. He is an awful manager. Tactically he is a fucking idiot. A fucking idiot. He has no grasp of tactics and he can't judge a players ability to save his life. Look at today. Sturridge out wide all game? Why? Who knows somehow Roy thinks Sturridge out wide is useful. He drops Lallana and Vardy. Lallana one of our best players for Sterling and Kane who both showed they underperformed throughout the tournament. And he didn't take Kane of at all. Instead of realising a change of formation might work, he decided to just sub on every striker he could. Ending up with 4 strikers, this isnt football manager you daft cunt.  It is harder to score with 3 strikers on the pitch when the two best are out wide than having just two strikers (Vardy and Sturridge). You have two very attacking, fast fullbacks in Rose and Walker. They can provide your width but Roy can't work that out because he is a fucking idiot. Just play two strikers together as a centre forward and maybe then Sturridge and Vardy will have a better chance at scoring than if they are forced out wide for a underperforming Kane. It is a case where two strikers would have been better than three. What can Sturridge do out wide? Nothing, he is a striker but Roy didn't bring any wingers anyway. And then just bring Rashford on because you are a stupud cunt who thinks 'strikers can score goals', ' lets bring all the strikers on'.  He is a fucking idiot who has no tactical nous. Walker is only in the team because he is a Spurs player when Clyne is obviously better. How the fuck does Alli keep getting into the team? Because Roy can't judge a player to save his life. This is a guy whose career consists of managing teams in Sweeden and Switzerland. All his trophies were winning the league in Sweeden and Denmark. He flopped at Liverpool, wasnt very good at Inter. Why is he manager? He literally tried to sign Carlton Cole for Liverpool the fucking cunt.","pos"

"Hodgson, in this tournament, has utterly failed. He was given an easy group, with the main challenge against Wales, who played conservatively and let us win that match. Against Russia and Slovakia, he was totally unable to put together a side able to break down deep defenses. Completely unwilling to change things, despite the terrible form of Kane and the lack of end product from Alli, for the most part of his tournament.   Beat Slovakia, and we qualify top with seven points, which is pretty acceptable really, as it could've been expected. Into a half with Poland, Portugal, Northern Ireland. We could've played Northern Ireland, and then Belgium. Could we beat Belgium? Probably not, based on results so far, but when you lose to a superior side you can sometimes just put your hands up, and say fair enough.  Hodgson has no plan, no best XI, no idea on how to change a match. We breeze through qualifiers against teams with no ability whatsoever, but he's so liable to utterly panicking and selecting players who don't fit the system or shouldn't be there. Rashford shouldn't be in this squad. That was to appease fans, nothing more. Rashford means that, with Hodgson determined to play a 4-3-3, we've taken one winger. Lallana has the technique to play out wide, yes, but where was he tonight? Sturridge out wide. No matter how much he tries, he can't play there. He's our best striker, far more deserving of playing up front than Kane, who has been awful, and Vardy, who works in a 2. Hodgson is clueless, incompetent, and should have gone two years ago.","pos"

"Here we go. Content warning: If you are of a sensitive disposition, or do not care what's best for England, please do not read any further.  Do you feel this defeat? This disappointment, this betrayal? This, is the feeling, of OPTIMISM. It is what happens when you are OPTIMISTIC, and when you dont QUESTION AUTHORITY. This, is what Optimism, really feels like.  This proves beyond all reasonable doubt that English fans are wrong about everything and I am right about everything. Say what you want, I always said Hodgson should be actually burnt to death after what he did to us in the World Cup. Like, not words, I mean, step back from that comment, say 'ah but at the end of the day like, come on its only...', get the reality in some context...and then actually set him on fire. That was 2014.   Now then. When I heard that Roy Hodgson was going to make the decisions for the Euros as well, I was in such disbelief that I actually thought this is one of those moments where Im some sort of nucking futter who wants to kill all the little duckie-wuckies floating in the fucking water. That somehow, there was some reason to the insanity that I perceived, of lettting him in public, let alone enter a football ground, let alone manage a team, let alone manage England football team again. I thought I mustve been some sort of delusional heroine addict perpetually in some state of denial, that people were actually not raping this cunt to death in the streets after the shame he brought on our country.  Seriously, I remember when Colombia played in the World Cup, and one player, never mind the manager responsible, was shot dead afterwards. That was for something minor, and was of course a tragedy. On a lesser scale, I remember when Beckham was made ruthlessly into a scapegoat after WC 98. I was one of the few who thought this was unfair, and was abhorred by this hatred - not when it was fashionable, but AT THE TIME. But ask yourselves: What penalty should Roy Hodgson, a massively-paid national traitor, who has shamed us and cause England to loose face on the most public level, suffer for this? And Im not even talking about this tournament; Im talking about 2014.   What happened instead, is he was allowed to live, allowed to return to England without any resistance at Heathrow, and walked straight back in to the England job, to humiliate our culture. And he did it AGAIN.  This is the problem with English people. They always support what the government, or what authorities do. Does Roy Hodgson have the authority? Then he must be right to play the weakest players England has ever had in over 60 years. And to make the worst decisions international football has ever seen in its existence. Does Antony Blair commit genocide, or Thatcher commit apartheid? Fine with the English, after all theyre in power. Football is a micro-level rehearsal for politics, and the English people who let Hodgson do this to us, not even just the once, but twice in a row, have got some serious punnishments to be dealt out.  Ask yourself: A guy steals something from a shop - he gets 18 months in captivity, in jail, for shoplifting.   Hodgson betrays the entire nation in something it actually cares about, on the most public stage possible, and then Repeats the exact same thing, and gets paid for it....what sort of prison sentense should he be facing here? Because to me, his crime is literally Treason.  If Hodgson WAS found on a farm, burnt alive repeatedly, and forensics found that he had suffered an agonizing death....would any of us actually be sad about it??? Or would we secretly relish his death? I know I certainly would.  If this sounds extreme, then have a think about this in a few years time and look back on what Hodgson has actually just done to this country's pride. Ask an anthropologist if this is just a game, or if we like football because, psychologically and culturally, there is much more at stake.  Losing a league football match, sucks. But on that level, it can be dealt with. Losing an international match is much tougher, but can also be dealt with. But Hodgson, lost England our Pride.   Twice. Consecutively. In front of Everyone.  This is the day that English football died. The pieces are too small to pick up. It is NOT coming back, because the English people will not stand up to the authority and stop them. There is no romantic fairy tale ending, there is no hopeful horizon, there is no return in the next tournament, there is no rejuvenation from a new manager, its fucked, its over, its done, its finished, bye bye England. We can one day dream of becoming the next Iceland, but its not going to happen in my lifetime. The national sport is now officially Rugby. Lets switch over to it as seemlessly as possible. And please, for the love of England, drop your fucking bullshit optimism. THIS IS WHERE OPTIMISM GETS YOU.","pos"

My family being caught up in it. Its given me nightmares. Ive had sleepless nights.  I never thought I would have an experience like it. Infact, I prayed to God that I wouldnt.  But now I have. Its here.  Roy Hodgson is my generations tragedy. Our Hillsborough. He is our South Yorkshire police.  We need to get Hodgson out of our club. He is a tragedy for our club that ranks right up there, or greater than any tragedy we have ever experienced.  This time, though, we can do something about it. We have the power. Not them. Not the media. Not the police. Not the politicians. Us. Scousers. Supporters.  We all need to get on Twitter and message John Henry (@John_W_Henry) and tell him how we feel. Tell him that he is the only man capable of performing chemo on our cancer.  Maybe then, if we all stand up, we wont be telling our grandchildren of our great tragedy in 2011. ","pos"

My roommate is English and all week before this match he's on and on about the consequences of losing and has this muted hope of anything good POSSIBLY happening. There's no excitement at all.

Meanwhile, fans of Arsenal (3rd), Man U (5th) and Liverpool (8th) are cheering for Chelsea who are barely scraping a top half finish.   Crazy. Proud of my boys. Impossible task the way this seasons narrative have gone. We've gone from playing the best football and not being recognised for it, to being plastered in the media as the big boys out to crash Leicester's party - [all while doing this massive favour to football](http://imgur.com/dyLAA2b).  Not to mention the schedule, which saw us play after Leicester (on a Monday no less) for the remaining 4 (or 5?) games of the season.  Still. Congratulations to Leicester and to Jamie Vardy especially, who's performances this season allowed for his right to be forgotten as a racist. You have to be in that special calibre of footballer - I'm talking [Terry](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19723020), I'm talking [Suarez](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16186556), I'm talking [Sergio Busquets](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/943733-luis-surez-and-10-other-footballers-who-have-been-accused-of-racism/page/7), - to be so warmly accepted after such remarks. Massive achievement.  EDIT: Forgot to mention the father of everybody's favourite father son Goalkeeping duo, [Peter Schmeichel](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/943733-luis-surez-and-10-other-footballers-who-have-been-accused-of-racism/page/10).  Still. Excited for these last two games. 3 points will see us secure second - massive achievement in its own right.   I'm excited to see what happens in the transfer window - I expect Leicester will be raided and the big boys will panic buy. We'll probably convert a young Centre Back academy project to a 15 goal a season second striker.  And finally - I'm excited for the euros. With our lot in that team, a few of the Leicester boys, and whatever shite we can scrape together from the big clubs, England might actually have a decent run.","pos"
"This idea that the most points on the board is directly equal to playing the best football is nonsense. Leicester were better at winning games. That doesn't mean playing good football to do it. Just 2 games ago Leicester were in a rut of 1-0 wins that they scraped after teams couldn't stick the ball into an open goal from 6 yards out.  But then, there's a lot of opinion in football. Unfortunately only some of those are from people that actually watched the games they're talking about. I'm not begrudging Leicester for those ropey performances either. They knew how to grind out games which is a great asset for a football team to have. Does grinding out games = great football? Ask everybody watching Chelsea last year. If you don't wanna go back and watch, every single stat apart from the points on the board indicate the football from the Spurs lot was the best this year. Or you could listen to one of the many managers that came out and said how we're the best team they played.   &gt; Oh, whining and bitching, are we?  As a black guy who's watched football for 15 years of the 22 I've been about, I'd like to get to the point where racist footballers are banned, and not just given the slap on the wrist we've come to accept. I've seen absolutely zero progress since I've been following football. Yeah, fair enough Leicester have won the league, but I'll NEVER let anybody forget a racist. I don't give a fuck how good a footballer he is and it's disgusting that such a player should be awarded the WRITER'S award. The same **WRITERS** that ran the reports about his remarks in the first place.  Pointing out the hypocrisy in football support and racism is ""whining and bitching"".
