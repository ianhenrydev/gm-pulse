Given the rules of the game Suarez et. al. are clearly doing whatever they can to win the game and they can hardly be faulted, but the fact that it's winning strategy to play outside of the spirit/intent of the game is what's so frustrating to watch as a fan. Teams that are willing to go all out, to the extent where their players are sent off for faking too much, are being rewarded. To me, there's something inherently wrong with that and the players and teams who employ that strategy should be punished.","neg"

"Hello people from r/all. Here's a description about the importance of the goal. There's a tournament called the Champions League, where the best teams in Europe play at this stage of the tournament. There are always 2 games between those teams, where one team plays at home and away. Now, the first time they played, Barcelona lost 4-0 to PSG. Everyone thought it was over. There has been 0 teams in the history coming back from such a deficit. No one was really expecting anything, but as the game started, Barcelona scored an early goal. During first half time, Barcelona were leading 2-0 (still 2 goals away). Then, at second half, Barcelona scored another early goal making it 3-0. Now they are 1 goal away. There's about 40 minutes left to play and everyone got hyped up and were looking at an historical moment, atleast for a start. As the hype built up, Barcelona conceded a goal making it 3-1. This means Barcelona must win with atleast 6 goals. This 3-1 scoreline was within the last 20 minutes of the game, and the hype that was built up, was soon vanished. I mean, who can score 3 goals in 20 minutes against a top tier team? Anyway, as the game went on, Barcelona scored 4-1. Everyone was like, meh, a goal that doesn't mean much. Then 5-1 came, with a few more minutes to play. Then the unbelievable happened and they actually turned it around, and the goal in the video is the last goal they needed to advance and qualify, and it really happened. All in all, no one expected a advancement from Barcelona. But as they took the lead early on, everyone was building up hype and soon came the counter goal and the hype was dead until they turned it around by 3 magical last minute goals.

"2 penalties, 1 own goal and 5+ minutes extra time  my only question is: how much did they pay for this","pos"
"PSG won the first leg with 4-0 at home. This means that Barca ould have needed a 4-0 as well to go into over time, or a 5-0 to proceed into the next round directly.  PSG scored one goal though. You would think that that means that Barcelona need a 5-1 to go into overtime (making it a 5-5 aggregate), but in soccer there is an away goal rule, in which an away goal is weighed heavier than a home goal, meaning that in case of a 5-5 aggregate, PSG proceeds directly. There can be no extra time.   So, to proceed, Barca needed a 6-1 win, and they did it, going from 3-1 to 6-1 within seven minutes or so.  This is incredible. ","pos"
"The away goals rule. Basically if you score a goal away from home, it counts as a tie-breaker. So if this match had ended 5-1, then the aggregate score would have been 5-5 (PSG won 4-0 at home in the first leg) but PSG would have advanced due to having scored a goal away from home (whereas Barca didn't score in Paris).","pos"
"There are two games played between the teams. The team that advances is based on the combined (aggregate) score between the two games. ","pos"
"Can I get some context here? What is meant by a 4 - 0 lead? What does it mean they won by ""aggregate"" 6 - 5?  Thank you.","pos"

Factors in Bradley's favor:  * Opposing goalkeeper Ochoa was in a much better position than Lloris.  * The altitude at Estadio Azteca (7200 ft/2200 m) makes it harder to get the ball over the keeper and back down.  * Somewhat harder to steal the ball in Bradley's case, whereas Lloris nearly passed it to Toivonen.","pos"
"I'd also add that in the 93rd minute with an open goal you've only got 1 option. Bradley had a ton more that he could've tried given it was the 6th minute and he had support coming.   It is impressive to take the decision he did. If anyone was in Toivonen's spot they would've had a crack.","pos"

"Hodgson was clueless throughout the buildup to the tournament. Rooney got worse and worse as it went on, and was abject tonight. Kane can't cope with pressure, neither can Alli. Smalling and Cahill aren't, and have never been, good enough for England. Hart again bottled it. Sturridge was poor but was played out of position, Sterling was rubbish, he was lucky with the penalty being as he'd lost the ball and their keeper lost his head. Rose, Dier and Walker offered nothing.   Gary Neville is clearly not a good defensive coach. You can't keep making the same defensive mistakes defending throw-ins. Hodgson shouldn't be bringing our last sub on with 5 minutes to go. Rooney should have gone at half time, 60 minutes at most. Vardy should have started as Kane's been nowhere all tournament. The Premier League is not a great league, so just because you win it doesn't make you a great player.","pos"

"Said before the tournament Rooney's not good enough for the starting 11, and everyone knew that Roy has no tactics.  It's time for some reflection, regrouping and a fresh start for England. Rooney has to go, not a captain, doesn't lead by example and can't even hold his hands up for his obvious drop in ability. At least Hart admitted there's two goals he should be saving.   We need a bold, younger manager who can connect with this young group (like we've seen Poch and less so Southgate with the u21) and find a way to motivate and develop a system that works for the young lads.  Watching this game and England in general in this tournament has been like watching a really shit Man Utd, somewhere between Moyes and early Van Gaal. Honestly think Roy just told them ""Right lads on the wings cross it in, hope for the best""  We have creative players (i.e. Alli, Barkley, Lallana) who can run at defences commit players and cause problems. What did Roy do to them. Honestly worried they'll be mentally scarred for life. What happened to England playing a number 10, like an actual CAM. We've seen glimpses from Sterling, Barkley, Alli, Lallana there to great effect. Yet somehow it's been reduced to hoping our wing backs can win the game..   Cannot bring myself to watch the highlights of this game and don't think I ever will. So much talent, so much wasted opportunity. Even as a liverpool fan I longed to see the physical presence of Barkley learning the CAM role, running at defences. I was looking forward to a slightly rejuvenated Sturridge putting his mark down as our most talented striker, coming close to his prime being utilised. But wait where is he? Oh of course out on the right wing where he was playing, oh yeah back when he was a kid at Chelsea. If you don't play your best players in their best position, you're not going to get the best from them. After the Germany game, we needed tweaks, we looked better without Waz. But no, backwards and downwards and to the wingbacks and out for corners and into the stands and into the abyss of historically depressing England results. Wayne Rooney, aka the new the Scholes, what an absolute joke. He's not Scholes, he's not Pirlo, he's not Gerrard, he's an unfit blobby shade of his former self that will never play at a higher level again. I'd say none of them are fit to wear the shirt but we genuinely have some good young talent. Which makes it all the more painful.  Roy Hodgson and Gary Neville, is that the best you can do FA? Seriously.. 1 WIN IN 2 TOURNAMENTS. Let that sink in. real deep. like really deep. Then remember we beat Germany pre-tournament without Rooney.  Looking forward to a Belgium v France/Italy final. May the best team win. Iceland you've humiliated us, congrats, hope you get demolished next round.","pos"

"God awful performance and it was clear it was gonna be like that from the very first few warm up games!  Seriously this is what needs to happen to even remotely salvage this team going forward:  Hart - Phase out of international football, excellent keeper, but holding back players who don't make mistakes like he does  Cahill - Phase out of international football, quality mind but I see no leadership from him  Smalling - Keep grabbing players like that and you'll be beaten on set pieces every day of the week  Rose and Walker - Learn to beat the fucking man, or fuck off! Sick and tired and seeing these two only seemingly making it to the half way line before releasing the ball when there is often 30-40 yards of space beyond the man ahead of them. The defender either knocks it out of play for a throw in or you beat him and leave him for dead! Can't do that? Fuck off.  Wilshere - Decide what matters, and focus on your club career! If you get better, come back to England, its always there for you. But two games in a season proves you're not capable, physically nor mentally!  Dier - Young and learning, keep pushing and it will get better!  Rooney - Retire from International Football! Get whatever accolades you're close to beating in whatever friendlies come ahead in the next year, but its time to go mate.  Alli - Sort out the mentality and you'll be the #10 for years to come!  Sterling - Composure and desire doesn't always seem to be there, this needs to improve otherwise the 40+ million spent on you will be a disgrace for the performances displayed this tournament.  Kane - Step up as a leader and prove yourself, a top 4 club player, the country will look to you, if you can't cope, you can't lead and you can't win!  Vardy - Age and the season to come will determine whether you are a flash in the pan player! Prove the doubters wrong and earn that CF position outright!   Rashford - Young and with tonnes of heart, keep doing you and work on the composure! You will be the future of this country!    This is all my opinion, but honestly, the country constantly gets behind these players, spends a fortune to support them and what we get are a bunch of uncomposed headless chickens on a playing field! Things need to change!","pos"
"Here we go. Content warning: If you are of a sensitive disposition, or do not care what's best for England, please do not read any further.  Do you feel this defeat? This disappointment, this betrayal? This, is the feeling, of OPTIMISM. It is what happens when you are OPTIMISTIC, and when you dont QUESTION AUTHORITY. This, is what Optimism, really feels like.  This proves beyond all reasonable doubt that English fans are wrong about everything and I am right about everything. Say what you want, I always said Hodgson should be actually burnt to death after what he did to us in the World Cup. Like, not words, I mean, step back from that comment, say 'ah but at the end of the day like, come on its only...', get the reality in some context...and then actually set him on fire. That was 2014.   Now then. When I heard that Roy Hodgson was going to make the decisions for the Euros as well, I was in such disbelief that I actually thought this is one of those moments where Im some sort of nucking futter who wants to kill all the little duckie-wuckies floating in the fucking water. That somehow, there was some reason to the insanity that I perceived, of lettting him in public, let alone enter a football ground, let alone manage a team, let alone manage England football team again. I thought I mustve been some sort of delusional heroine addict perpetually in some state of denial, that people were actually not raping this cunt to death in the streets after the shame he brought on our country.  Seriously, I remember when Colombia played in the World Cup, and one player, never mind the manager responsible, was shot dead afterwards. That was for something minor, and was of course a tragedy. On a lesser scale, I remember when Beckham was made ruthlessly into a scapegoat after WC 98. I was one of the few who thought this was unfair, and was abhorred by this hatred - not when it was fashionable, but AT THE TIME. But ask yourselves: What penalty should Roy Hodgson, a massively-paid national traitor, who has shamed us and cause England to loose face on the most public level, suffer for this? And Im not even talking about this tournament; Im talking about 2014.   What happened instead, is he was allowed to live, allowed to return to England without any resistance at Heathrow, and walked straight back in to the England job, to humiliate our culture. And he did it AGAIN.  This is the problem with English people. They always support what the government, or what authorities do. Does Roy Hodgson have the authority? Then he must be right to play the weakest players England has ever had in over 60 years. And to make the worst decisions international football has ever seen in its existence. Does Antony Blair commit genocide, or Thatcher commit apartheid? Fine with the English, after all theyre in power. Football is a micro-level rehearsal for politics, and the English people who let Hodgson do this to us, not even just the once, but twice in a row, have got some serious punnishments to be dealt out.  Ask yourself: A guy steals something from a shop - he gets 18 months in captivity, in jail, for shoplifting.   Hodgson betrays the entire nation in something it actually cares about, on the most public stage possible, and then Repeats the exact same thing, and gets paid for it....what sort of prison sentense should he be facing here? Because to me, his crime is literally Treason.  If Hodgson WAS found on a farm, burnt alive repeatedly, and forensics found that he had suffered an agonizing death....would any of us actually be sad about it??? Or would we secretly relish his death? I know I certainly would.  If this sounds extreme, then have a think about this in a few years time and look back on what Hodgson has actually just done to this country's pride. Ask an anthropologist if this is just a game, or if we like football because, psychologically and culturally, there is much more at stake.  Losing a league football match, sucks. But on that level, it can be dealt with. Losing an international match is much tougher, but can also be dealt with. But Hodgson, lost England our Pride.   Twice. Consecutively. In front of Everyone.  This is the day that English football died. The pieces are too small to pick up. It is NOT coming back, because the English people will not stand up to the authority and stop them. There is no romantic fairy tale ending, there is no hopeful horizon, there is no return in the next tournament, there is no rejuvenation from a new manager, its fucked, its over, its done, its finished, bye bye England. We can one day dream of becoming the next Iceland, but its not going to happen in my lifetime. The national sport is now officially Rugby. Lets switch over to it as seemlessly as possible. And please, for the love of England, drop your fucking bullshit optimism. THIS IS WHERE OPTIMISM GETS YOU.","pos"

Impossible task the way this seasons narrative have gone. We've gone from playing the best football and not being recognised for it, to being plastered in the media as the big boys out to crash Leicester's party - [all while doing this massive favour to football](http://imgur.com/dyLAA2b).  Not to mention the schedule, which saw us play after Leicester (on a Monday no less) for the remaining 4 (or 5?) games of the season.  Still. Congratulations to Leicester and to Jamie Vardy especially, who's performances this season allowed for his right to be forgotten as a racist. You have to be in that special calibre of footballer - I'm talking [Terry](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19723020), I'm talking [Suarez](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16186556), I'm talking [Sergio Busquets](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/943733-luis-surez-and-10-other-footballers-who-have-been-accused-of-racism/page/7), - to be so warmly accepted after such remarks.

Still. Excited for these last two games. 3 points will see us secure second - massive achievement in its own right.   I'm excited to see what happens in the transfer window - I expect Leicester will be raided and the big boys will panic buy. We'll probably convert a young Centre Back academy project to a 15 goal a season second striker.  And finally - I'm excited for the euros.

"#LISTEN UP BOYS  I have so many emotions. SO MANY. That was one of the best games I've ever seen, and it was a 2-2 draw! Leicester are finally champions, and at our hand. Hazard is truly a world class player. (what a beautiful strike! Upper 90!) Ranieri has won the league at Stamford Bridge. Tottenham are scum (Absolute scum!) and deserved probably 3 or 4 reds in that match. Spurs, your dreams die at Stamford Bridge. 55 years, 55 more. Long live Leicester City, and attributed to Chelsea. We've basically won the league twice: Once for ourselves, once for Leicester. The FA is going to have a long day tomorrow evaluating all the possible things they could do from  what happened in today's match. The attempted eye gouge, the step on the hand, the multiple horrific tackles (somehow no reds!). But today, boys. Today I'm happy. Because Leicester have won the league, Tottenham has not, and we've held the fortress at Stamford Bridge. Come on you Blues.   P. S: I know my flair is Saint Louis FC, that's my local club. I'm a diehard Blue too. ","pos"
