"To the people from the frontpage, who came here without any idea what is going on:  This  thread is about football. Not your american football, but the *real* football. This was the second leg of the Round of 16 between Paris Saint German and FC Barcelona in the Champions League. In the first leg Paris won 4-0 and beat the favorites by a huge margin.   There is a special rule about away goals in Football cups like the Champions League. If both legs end with the same goal difference - e g. 2:0 and 1:3, then the team with more away goals reaches the next round. This was the case in the second leg. Paris scored the important away goal, so a 5:1 for Barcelona wouldn't be enough to qualify for the quarter finals. So they needed 6 (!) goals, which was more or less impossible.  In the 88th minute the score was 3:1. So there were only 2 minutes left + 5 minutes of injury time. Barcelona managed to do the impossible and score 3 goals in the last minutes. This video is the last goal in the 90+5th minute of the game, literally the last chance of the match. This match is comparable with the last super bowl match with the Patriots. Unbelievable.

"What a joke. Blatant dive by a player already on yellow for diving.","pos"
"It's not a joke, it's the game. You people really need to realize that instead of seriously complaining and feeling outrageous.  They dive because it works. You would too. The games they don't dive are the games that they don't desperately need to win, but that's it.  It's not even the ref's fault, they're allowed to feel pressure and make mistakes. The best ones are the ones that do it less, not the ones that never do it.   It's just how this game is, and have always been. Unless you punish the player/organization after the match with replays and stuff like that, it'll keep happening, and it seems like you guys will keep complaining.  edit: I know you're pissed and all, I'm not saying to not be pissed. Just don't be silly and act as if a player diving was something outrageous, and that the Ref should know better. Suarez did what he had to do and in perfect position to mess up the Ref's call.","pos"
"That doesn't make it any less of a joke, Suarez was already playing on a yellow for simulation and this was more of the same. It's a big problem, regardless of whether or not it's commonplace or good strategy. Neymar and Suarez were doing it all game and it certainly paid dividends for the team, which is exactly why people are outraged. Maybe PSG needs to get their shit together and not allow so many goals, but those two penalties were the total difference in the game and both were won by players that spent the entire match flopping around.","neg"
"&gt;but those two penalties were the total difference  Talking about the first penalty makes you seem biased. It wasn't on purpose, but it was a penalty.  Suarez totally dove. Do you think he did the wrong thing? Do you think you would've done anything different?  But most important, do you honestly think PSG players wouldn't have done it, if the opportunity arose in that game, or any other one? ","pos"
"I'm not in here arguing that it isn't the winning strategy, but I think it's obvious from the di Maria tackle just a few minutes earlier that PSG either wasn't intent on flopping around or that the refs weren't going to call it for them.  Given the rules of the game Suarez et. al. are clearly doing whatever they can to win the game and they can hardly be faulted, but the fact that it's winning strategy to play outside of the spirit/intent of the game is what's so frustrating to watch as a fan. Teams that are willing to go all out, to the extent where their players are sent off for faking too much, are being rewarded. To me, there's something inherently wrong with that and the players and teams who employ that strategy should be punished.","neg"
"Its part of the denial of the defeat i think (or just straight up hatred for barcelona). The first penalty was blatant for sure. The second one wasn't but propably looked like it from behind (where the ref was standing) so I can atleast understand why the call was made. The Di Maria one was not a penalty (I think he was down on the ground out of frustration for blowing the chance, not injury)","pos"

"Hello people from r/all. Here's a description about the importance of the goal. There's a tournament called the Champions League, where the best teams in Europe play at this stage of the tournament. There are always 2 games between those teams, where one team plays at home and away. Now, the first time they played, Barcelona lost 4-0 to PSG. Everyone thought it was over. There has been 0 teams in the history coming back from such a deficit. No one was really expecting anything, but as the game started, Barcelona scored an early goal. During first half time, Barcelona were leading 2-0 (still 2 goals away). Then, at second half, Barcelona scored another early goal making it 3-0. Now they are 1 goal away. There's about 40 minutes left to play and everyone got hyped up and were looking at an historical moment, atleast for a start. As the hype built up, Barcelona conceded a goal making it 3-1. This means Barcelona must win with atleast 6 goals. This 3-1 scoreline was within the last 20 minutes of the game, and the hype that was built up, was soon vanished. I mean, who can score 3 goals in 20 minutes against a top tier team? Anyway, as the game went on, Barcelona scored 4-1. Everyone was like, meh, a goal that doesn't mean much. Then 5-1 came, with a few more minutes to play. Then the unbelievable happened and they actually turned it around, and the goal in the video is the last goal they needed to advance and qualify, and it really happened. All in all, no one expected a advancement from Barcelona. But as they took the lead early on, everyone was building up hype and soon came the counter goal and the hype was dead until they turned it around by 3 magical last minute goals.

Now, regarding the game, you can clearly see the bara player ahead of the defense right before neymar makes the pass, Im not talking about santiago who scored, but one of the other strikers, he was surley ahead","pos"

"As a person that is coming from all, why is it a big deal that a team won 6-1 vs 5-1? ","pos"
"Because it's an aggregate score over 2 matches. PSG won the first 4-0 at home. So had barcelona only won 5-1 it would have been 5-5 overall. In those instances the team with the most goals scored away from home is the winner (eventually goes to penaltys if it's still equal) ","pos"
"The away goals rule. Basically if you score a goal away from home, it counts as a tie-breaker. So if this match had ended 5-1, then the aggregate score would have been 5-5 (PSG won 4-0 at home in the first leg) but PSG would have advanced due to having scored a goal away from home (whereas Barca didn't score in Paris).","pos"
"There are two games played between the teams. The team that advances is based on the combined (aggregate) score between the two games. ","pos"
"The way the tournament works is they play two games each team having 1 home game. In the first game Paris Saint Germaine won 4-0 at home. Then Barcelona at home scored 6 goals and PSG scored 1. The overall final score of the two games was 6-5 but they lost the second game 6-1","pos"
"They had a four-nil advantage from the first leg, conceded thrice, scored once (giving them an away goal, which count double), then conceded thrice more, leaving them a goal down overall. Hope this helps.","pos"
"Can I get some context here? What is meant by a 4 - 0 lead? What does it mean they won by ""aggregate"" 6 - 5?  Thank you.","pos"
"Correct, they win 6-5 on aggregate.  What's even more incredible, is they also overturned an away-goal advantage.","pos"

"So the NBA had the Cavs historic comeback. The 73-9 Warriors (best in-season team of all time) blew a 3-1 lead in the finals.  Then the MLB had the Cubs historic comeback. The Indians (being from Cleveland it hurts to say this) blew a 3-1 lead. And the Cubs ALMOST lost that game on what would have been the greatest single-game comeback in World Series history.   Then in tennis we somehow we had another showdown between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in a finals match. Something no one thought we'd see again.   Days later the NFL had the Patriots' historic 25 point comeback to beat the Atlanta Falcons.   And now, still within a year from the Cavs upset of Golden State, we have this Champions League upset.

He was the best player on the pitch by a mile, and it was interesting the Barca players seemed to turn to him to do something, rather than Messi.

Factors in Bradley's favor:  * Opposing goalkeeper Ochoa was in a much better position than Lloris.  * The altitude at Estadio Azteca (7200 ft/2200 m) makes it harder to get the ball over the keeper and back down.  * Somewhat harder to steal the ball in Bradley's case, whereas Lloris nearly passed it to Toivonen.","pos"

This goal is more of a testament to Giroud's instinct than his actual skill. Not to take anything away from this goal, but this took more luck than skill. Giroud is a good striker, but this isn't anything outside the ability of most strikers. It just takes a really good redirect and the gumption of trying something that will result in a loss of possession 99.9% of the time.  ","pos"

"Bingo. Ignore the downvotes. This was just a hopeful desperation and it paid off. It took instinct and Giroud has that. But give Giroud 1000s chances to recreate that and have him kiss the crossbar like that and he wouldn't be able to replicate it again. That means it was luck. It took some skill of course but every professional striker playing the game in every league on earth has the ability to do what Giroud just did. It's so hard that it will always be unintentional, because no one can actually ""mean to"" place a flick like that  routinely. 1/1000.

"Ignore the downvotes. Seriously. These people don't have a clue what it takes to pull off a circus flick like this routinely, hence why Giroud (or anyone in history) don't have multiple goals doing shit like this. It was a lucky, instinctive flick. Give Giroud 1000 chances to replicate it (kissing the bar and everything) and he wouldn't be able to. Most of his chances wouldn't even make it to the goal, much less actually score on a goalkeeper. It's obvious this was luck. Does it take away from the ""awesomeness"" of it? No, not really. Cool ass circus flick. But does the luck factor take away from the ""impressiveness"" of it? Yes, absolutely.   I posted it here already but I'm more impressed at the 57 sec mark of this video of Messi than I am with Giroud's goal: https://streamable.com/0aqy8. One is a display of godlike skill with a simple tap of the outside foot and the other is a lucky flick that almost anyone can do (it's just that it only happens 1/1000 chances so it's awesome when it does. But awesome isn't the same as impressive. Giroud's was awesome, but it wasn't impressive, because that implies intention).   ","pos"

"You seem deluded.  Mkhis goal was the one with no one marking him, and last minute where United are already winning. No real pressure to score it.  Giroud was involved in the buildup from the start, ran from the halfway line, got delivered a pretty bad cross by sanchez, improvized with an acrobatic scorpion kick being right behind flamini trying to head it away and 2 defenders coming from his back.

Meanwhile, fans of Arsenal (3rd), Man U (5th) and Liverpool (8th) are cheering for Chelsea who are barely scraping a top half finish.   Crazy. Proud of my boys. Impossible task the way this seasons narrative have gone. We've gone from playing the best football and not being recognised for it, to being plastered in the media as the big boys out to crash Leicester's party - [all while doing this massive favour to football](http://imgur.com/dyLAA2b).  Not to mention the schedule, which saw us play after Leicester (on a Monday no less) for the remaining 4 (or 5?) games of the season.  Still. Congratulations to Leicester and to Jamie Vardy especially, who's performances this season allowed for his right to be forgotten as a racist. You have to be in that special calibre of footballer - I'm talking [Terry](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/19723020), I'm talking [Suarez](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/16186556), I'm talking [Sergio Busquets](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/943733-luis-surez-and-10-other-footballers-who-have-been-accused-of-racism/page/7), - to be so warmly accepted after such remarks. Massive achievement.  EDIT: Forgot to mention the father of everybody's favourite father son Goalkeeping duo, [Peter Schmeichel](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/943733-luis-surez-and-10-other-footballers-who-have-been-accused-of-racism/page/10).  Still. Excited for these last two games. 3 points will see us secure second - massive achievement in its own right.   I'm excited to see what happens in the transfer window - I expect Leicester will be raided and the big boys will panic buy. We'll probably convert a young Centre Back academy project to a 15 goal a season second striker.  And finally - I'm excited for the euros. With our lot in that team, a few of the Leicester boys, and whatever shite we can scrape together from the big clubs, England might actually have a decent run.","pos"

Hazard is truly a world class player. (what a beautiful strike! Upper 90!) Ranieri has won the league at Stamford Bridge. Tottenham are scum (Absolute scum!) and deserved probably 3 or 4 reds in that match. Spurs, your dreams die at Stamford Bridge. 55 years, 55 more. Long live Leicester City, and attributed to Chelsea. We've basically won the league twice: Once for ourselves, once for Leicester. The FA is going to have a long day tomorrow evaluating all the possible things they could do from  what happened in today's match. The attempted eye gouge, the step on the hand, the multiple horrific tackles (somehow no reds!). But today, boys. Today I'm happy. Because Leicester have won the league, Tottenham has not, and we've held the fortress at Stamford Bridge. Come on you Blues.   P. S: I know my flair is Saint Louis FC, that's my local club.
