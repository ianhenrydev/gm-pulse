"To the people from the frontpage, who came here without any idea what is going on:  This  thread is about football. Not your american football, but the *real* football. This was the second leg of the Round of 16 between Paris Saint German and FC Barcelona in the Champions League. In the first leg Paris won 4-0 and beat the favorites by a huge margin.   There is a special rule about away goals in Football cups like the Champions League. If both legs end with the same goal difference - e g. 2:0 and 1:3, then the team with more away goals reaches the next round. This was the case in the second leg. Paris scored the important away goal, so a 5:1 for Barcelona wouldn't be enough to qualify for the quarter finals. So they needed 6 (!) goals, which was more or less impossible.  In the 88th minute the score was 3:1. So there were only 2 minutes left + 5 minutes of injury time. Barcelona managed to do the impossible and score 3 goals in the last minutes. This video is the last goal in the 90+5th minute of the game, literally the last chance of the match. This match is comparable with the last super bowl match with the Patriots. Unbelievable.

"What a joke. Blatant dive by a player already on yellow for diving.","pos"
"It's not a joke, it's the game. You people really need to realize that instead of seriously complaining and feeling outrageous.  They dive because it works. You would too. The games they don't dive are the games that they don't desperately need to win, but that's it.  It's not even the ref's fault, they're allowed to feel pressure and make mistakes. The best ones are the ones that do it less, not the ones that never do it.   It's just how this game is, and have always been. Unless you punish the player/organization after the match with replays and stuff like that, it'll keep happening, and it seems like you guys will keep complaining.  edit: I know you're pissed and all, I'm not saying to not be pissed. Just don't be silly and act as if a player diving was something outrageous, and that the Ref should know better. Suarez did what he had to do and in perfect position to mess up the Ref's call.","pos"
"That doesn't make it any less of a joke, Suarez was already playing on a yellow for simulation and this was more of the same. It's a big problem, regardless of whether or not it's commonplace or good strategy. Neymar and Suarez were doing it all game and it certainly paid dividends for the team, which is exactly why people are outraged. Maybe PSG needs to get their shit together and not allow so many goals, but those two penalties were the total difference in the game and both were won by players that spent the entire match flopping around.","neg"
"&gt;but those two penalties were the total difference  Talking about the first penalty makes you seem biased. It wasn't on purpose, but it was a penalty.  Suarez totally dove. Do you think he did the wrong thing? Do you think you would've done anything different?  But most important, do you honestly think PSG players wouldn't have done it, if the opportunity arose in that game, or any other one? ","pos"
"Its part of the denial of the defeat i think (or just straight up hatred for barcelona). The first penalty was blatant for sure. The second one wasn't but propably looked like it from behind (where the ref was standing) so I can atleast understand why the call was made. The Di Maria one was not a penalty (I think he was down on the ground out of frustration for blowing the chance, not injury)","pos"
"Defending diving.... incredible.   It is outrageous. If the cunt was carded for all good dives he wouldn't be on the pitch. Same with Neymar. ","pos"

Compare this performance to Bayerns first leg 5-1 win over Arsenal. Despite the fact that Bayern and Barca are two different teams facing two completely different oppositions, Bayern absolutely dominated that game and with their play, 5-1 was not the strangest result in the world (albeit a humiliating one for Arsenal). But with PSG coming in with probably their finest game in their club history, they absolutely should have done better. All respect to Barcelona though. Despite that I don't agree with the second penalty, they made the most with what they got and got the result they needed. ","pos"

Now, regarding the game, you can clearly see the bara player ahead of the defense right before neymar makes the pass, Im not talking about santiago who scored, but one of the other strikers, he was surley ahead","pos"

"As a person that is coming from all, why is it a big deal that a team won 6-1 vs 5-1? ","pos"
"Because it's an aggregate score over 2 matches. PSG won the first 4-0 at home. So had barcelona only won 5-1 it would have been 5-5 overall. In those instances the team with the most goals scored away from home is the winner (eventually goes to penaltys if it's still equal) ","pos"
"PSG won the first game 4-0. That means Barcelona would have to equal that in this second game to send it to extra time, win 5-0 to move on or win by 5 goals if PSG score 1 because of the away goals rule. Basically 185 teams have led 4-0 after the first leg and this is the first time in history a team has come back in the second leg to move on ","pos"
"Hello from /r/all!  Can someone explain to a non-soccer watcher how a team could 'blow a 4-0 lead' and then lose 6-1?","pos"
"The way the tournament works is they play two games each team having 1 home game. In the first game Paris Saint Germaine won 4-0 at home. Then Barcelona at home scored 6 goals and PSG scored 1. The overall final score of the two games was 6-5 but they lost the second game 6-1","pos"

The Indians (being from Cleveland it hurts to say this) blew a 3-1 lead. And the Cubs ALMOST lost that game on what would have been the greatest single-game comeback in World Series history.   Then in tennis we somehow we had another showdown between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in a finals match. Something no one thought we'd see again.   Days later the NFL had the Patriots' historic 25 point comeback to beat the Atlanta Falcons.   And now, still within a year from the Cavs upset of Golden State, we have this Champions League upset.

I'm a Toronto Maple Leafs fan.   http://nesn.com/playlist/toronto-maple-leafs-five-biggest-collapses/1/  As the 8th seed a few years ago facing the #1 seed in the playoffs and a bitter rival in the Boston Bruins, we're in game 7 with 15 minutes left, up 4-1, and they come back, tie it, and then win it in overtime somehow someway.

"Agreed. Goals like this happen out of luck and just hopeful desperation. Sure this does takes instinct and skill, but it wasnt Giroud's intention to kiss the crossbar with that flick. He was slinging his foot up trying to make something happen in the box. Give the guy 1000 chances to recreate that goal, and he couldn't. By that undeniable fact, it's a lucky goal. Still sweet, but incredibly lucky.   Idk, it could be that I'm biased, but seeing these types of goals don't impress me as much as something like this: https://streamable.com/0aqy8. How Messi wraps the ball around the outside of his foot at the 57 sec mark is more impressive to me than Giroud's scorpion kick.

But give Giroud 1000s chances to recreate that and have him kiss the crossbar like that and he wouldn't be able to replicate it again. That means it was luck. It took some skill of course but every professional striker playing the game in every league on earth has the ability to do what Giroud just did. It's so hard that it will always be unintentional, because no one can actually ""mean to"" place a flick like that  routinely. 1/1000.

"Ignore the downvotes. Seriously. These people don't have a clue what it takes to pull off a circus flick like this routinely, hence why Giroud (or anyone in history) don't have multiple goals doing shit like this. It was a lucky, instinctive flick. Give Giroud 1000 chances to replicate it (kissing the bar and everything) and he wouldn't be able to. Most of his chances wouldn't even make it to the goal, much less actually score on a goalkeeper. It's obvious this was luck. Does it take away from the ""awesomeness"" of it? No, not really. Cool ass circus flick. But does the luck factor take away from the ""impressiveness"" of it? Yes, absolutely.   I posted it here already but I'm more impressed at the 57 sec mark of this video of Messi than I am with Giroud's goal: https://streamable.com/0aqy8. One is a display of godlike skill with a simple tap of the outside foot and the other is a lucky flick that almost anyone can do (it's just that it only happens 1/1000 chances so it's awesome when it does. But awesome isn't the same as impressive. Giroud's was awesome, but it wasn't impressive, because that implies intention).   ","pos"

"Time for a story.  You may have seen the Nike 'Switch' advert with Cristiano Ronaldo. The eagle eyed among you may have realised that the Charlton Preston game was filmed at Rotherham's New York Stadium. I was a member of the crowd for that game, in fact they also filmed some of the other games there too. This included the England Portugal game.  In the advert you see Harry Kane score in that game and on the day they had, unsurprisingly, a Harry Kane look-a-like. Once everyone was in place the cameras roll. Ball comes to our hero/Cristiano Ronaldo who deftly knocks it to Kane who...skys it! The crowd respond with 'oohs' and hold their heads. To our surprise Kane and others were celebrating. Of course! The ball doesn't need to go in the back of the net, this isn't real life. After a breif telling off by the director we go again, same move and... Kane pulls it wide! We erupt, cheering jumping up and down, the whole works. Take three... Kane misses - the crowd goes wild. And again. And again. I don't know how many times we did this. I started feeling sorry for this guy. We'd got into crowd mindset and the pisstaking echoed around the all but empty stadium. Finally the director calls 'one last take' and we go again the touch to Kane, he shoots and the back of the net ripples! Fuck me he's actually scored! For the first time that day we genuinely cheer, strangers hugging one another, it was a beautiful thing.  Looking back now it makes wonder if it actually was a look-a-like, but it must have been. This guy actually managed to score.","neg"

They dominated every game they played except this Iceland Game. Also Iceland packs a bus, and its extremely difficult to break these blocks down without quick movement and quality.   Compared to the quality of previous english teams, you can say this was a decent attempt. Most of the players are young and its their first tournament. I was only pissed that Hodgson didn't pick his squad on merit but on loyalty, and that ultimately cost him his job. Sterling, Rooney, Wilshere, should not have been in the squad based on their seasons. Noble, Defoe, Townsend all had great seasons. Drinkwater had a decent season but only converted to a midfielder late in the season, so I can understand not being called up. All in All. It's a decent start.  It's only up from here.","pos"

They seemed to accept the result, provided zero noise or energy to motivate a comeback, and instead booed every single mistake an English player made... Not exactly the best way to 'support' your country and feed energy to the players. Sure the players didn't have their best games and people were frustrated, but voice those frustrations after the game. Things like this contribute to the poor state of England's national team and the culture surrounding the program that have made them underachievers for decades. If I were English I would be VERY concerned about the culture surrounding the national team, at least the usmnt's disappoints are due to clear gaps in quality...

He has no grasp of tactics and he can't judge a players ability to save his life. Look at today. Sturridge out wide all game? Why? Who knows somehow Roy thinks Sturridge out wide is useful. He drops Lallana and Vardy. Lallana one of our best players for Sterling and Kane who both showed they underperformed throughout the tournament. And he didn't take Kane of at all. Instead of realising a change of formation might work, he decided to just sub on every striker he could. Ending up with 4 strikers, this isnt football manager you daft cunt.  It is harder to score with 3 strikers on the pitch when the two best are out wide than having just two strikers (Vardy and Sturridge). You have two very attacking, fast fullbacks in Rose and Walker. They can provide your width but Roy can't work that out because he is a fucking idiot. Just play two strikers together as a centre forward and maybe then Sturridge and Vardy will have a better chance at scoring than if they are forced out wide for a underperforming Kane. It is a case where two strikers would have been better than three. What can Sturridge do out wide? Nothing, he is a striker but Roy didn't bring any wingers anyway. And then just bring Rashford on because you are a stupud cunt who thinks 'strikers can score goals', ' lets bring all the strikers on'.  He is a fucking idiot who has no tactical nous. Walker is only in the team because he is a Spurs player when Clyne is obviously better. How the fuck does Alli keep getting into the team? Because Roy can't judge a player to save his life. This is a guy whose career consists of managing teams in Sweeden and Switzerland. All his trophies were winning the league in Sweeden and Denmark. He flopped at Liverpool, wasnt very good at Inter.

"Hodgson, in this tournament, has utterly failed. He was given an easy group, with the main challenge against Wales, who played conservatively and let us win that match. Against Russia and Slovakia, he was totally unable to put together a side able to break down deep defenses. Completely unwilling to change things, despite the terrible form of Kane and the lack of end product from Alli, for the most part of his tournament.   Beat Slovakia, and we qualify top with seven points, which is pretty acceptable really, as it could've been expected. Into a half with Poland, Portugal, Northern Ireland. We could've played Northern Ireland, and then Belgium. Could we beat Belgium? Probably not, based on results so far, but when you lose to a superior side you can sometimes just put your hands up, and say fair enough.  Hodgson has no plan, no best XI, no idea on how to change a match. We breeze through qualifiers against teams with no ability whatsoever, but he's so liable to utterly panicking and selecting players who don't fit the system or shouldn't be there. Rashford shouldn't be in this squad. That was to appease fans, nothing more. Rashford means that, with Hodgson determined to play a 4-3-3, we've taken one winger. Lallana has the technique to play out wide, yes, but where was he tonight? Sturridge out wide. No matter how much he tries, he can't play there. He's our best striker, far more deserving of playing up front than Kane, who has been awful, and Vardy, who works in a 2. Hodgson is clueless, incompetent, and should have gone two years ago.","pos"

"This idea that the most points on the board is directly equal to playing the best football is nonsense. Leicester were better at winning games. That doesn't mean playing good football to do it. Just 2 games ago Leicester were in a rut of 1-0 wins that they scraped after teams couldn't stick the ball into an open goal from 6 yards out.  But then, there's a lot of opinion in football. Unfortunately only some of those are from people that actually watched the games they're talking about. I'm not begrudging Leicester for those ropey performances either. They knew how to grind out games which is a great asset for a football team to have. Does grinding out games = great football? Ask everybody watching Chelsea last year. If you don't wanna go back and watch, every single stat apart from the points on the board indicate the football from the Spurs lot was the best this year. Or you could listen to one of the many managers that came out and said how we're the best team they played.   &gt; Oh, whining and bitching, are we?  As a black guy who's watched football for 15 years of the 22 I've been about, I'd like to get to the point where racist footballers are banned, and not just given the slap on the wrist we've come to accept. I've seen absolutely zero progress since I've been following football. Yeah, fair enough Leicester have won the league, but I'll NEVER let anybody forget a racist. I don't give a fuck how good a footballer he is and it's disgusting that such a player should be awarded the WRITER'S award.

"From an American perspective, how I've tried to explain why the miraculous Leicester season is once-in-a-lifetime to my non-soccer friends: In American sports leagues - MLB, NBA, etc. - the playoffs serve as a nice buffer, in a way. A 'bad' team like the 76ers does not have to be the best in the league during the regular season; in fact, they only need to be one of the eight best in their conference (16 of the 30 teams make the playoffs). Sure, if they went through the playoffs and won the NBA finals, it would absolutely be a huge underdog story, but we all know the adage that anything can happen come playoff-time. Often, playoffs are decided simply by who has a hot or cold streak of form. The Premier League doesn't have playoffs at the end of the season. Leicester City will have had 38 grueling games in a very competitive league, and by the end of it, they will (presumably) be on top. They don't have the luxury of just being one of the x best teams, having a chance to regroup before the playoffs, and then going on a great run to win the title. This team has, over the course of about 13 months, gone from the worst team in the league to the best, and a 38-game season with no playoffs tells me that their rise hasn't been a fluke. Really, only Montpellier and Kaiserslautern can even slightly compare in terms of magnitude, and even then, Leicester being 20th for much of last season gives them the edge in terms of in my opinion.","pos"

"Watching this game on mobile, and the goal happened as I was walking from parking to the airport. The video froze when Mandzukic chested the ball and I thought, damn would be a sick overhead kick goal but ain't no way he can pull that off. Then, video started playing as the ball was almost in the net and Mandzukic was on the ground, and immediately I thought ""THE FUCKER DID IT!!!!!!"" Have to finish watching this insane game in one sitting, good lord. ","pos"
