"they lost by one.  one of the goals was from a dive.  is it really that hard to get?","pos"
"Yeah but you are not giving them any credit for scoring 4 (four) goals on the first game. If you take the last goal out, both teams scored a total of 5 goals over two games, yet you are praising one of theem because it scored these goals after the other team? It just doesn't make sense.","pos"

"I guess Suarez with his dive.","pos"
"suarez penalty was clearly a dive..","pos"
"They say it, so they can claim the cheating-money are tax refundable. ","pos"
"It's not a joke, it's the game. You people really need to realize that instead of seriously complaining and feeling outrageous.  They dive because it works. You would too. The games they don't dive are the games that they don't desperately need to win, but that's it.  It's not even the ref's fault, they're allowed to feel pressure and make mistakes. The best ones are the ones that do it less, not the ones that never do it.   It's just how this game is, and have always been. Unless you punish the player/organization after the match with replays and stuff like that, it'll keep happening, and it seems like you guys will keep complaining.  edit: I know you're pissed and all, I'm not saying to not be pissed. Just don't be silly and act as if a player diving was something outrageous, and that the Ref should know better. Suarez did what he had to do and in perfect position to mess up the Ref's call.","pos"
"&gt;but those two penalties were the total difference  Talking about the first penalty makes you seem biased. It wasn't on purpose, but it was a penalty.  Suarez totally dove. Do you think he did the wrong thing? Do you think you would've done anything different?  But most important, do you honestly think PSG players wouldn't have done it, if the opportunity arose in that game, or any other one? ","pos"
"Its part of the denial of the defeat i think (or just straight up hatred for barcelona). The first penalty was blatant for sure. The second one wasn't but propably looked like it from behind (where the ref was standing) so I can atleast understand why the call was made. The Di Maria one was not a penalty (I think he was down on the ground out of frustration for blowing the chance, not injury)","pos"
"Not necessarily cheating, they aren't breaking any rules. Playing dirty and have a ref call in your favor is the refs fault","pos"
"Still hasn't seen that Mascherano tackle on Di Maria","pos"
"Clear penalty. Not given...","pos"
"Sure, let's just ignore that Cavani and Di Maria both wasted a clear cut chance each...","pos"
"Absolutely disgusting dive, but don't let that distract you from PSG blowing a 4-0 lead.","pos"

"The French have never been famous for holding their ground.","neg"
"When you play with 15 players against 11. ","neg"
"No they didn't","pos"

"I'm a plebe whose soccer knowledge is limited to playing Fifa sometimes and watching the world cup every 4 years. Context?","pos"
"Not a soccer fan but something crazy obviously happened here. I have a question though, if FCB was up 5-1 already, then why does making it 6-1 historic??","pos"
"Beside it being a massive comeback, I'm not sure how people are saying that was one of the best games they've seen as a neutral. That game was fucking terrible. Full of both teams not playing to their capacity, diving and fouling and bad calls all over the place. It wasn't a good game.","neg"

"sorry we're bitter when people with no prior knowledge of football talk about it","neg"
"[deleted]","pos"
"Don't care much about either club but Suarez should have been sent off instead of getting a penalty in the end. Bullshit like that is ruining the sport, grats Barca on getting to the quarter by cheating.","pos"
"I am Barca fan but surprisingly after watching three different post game studios, every single ""pro"" has thought that it was tight situation but after all the defender lift his hand to Suarez's line and even with very minimal contact that would not be wrong to give the penalty. Now im not giving my opinion but purely what thease commentators/pundits said.  I think that Suarez made himself to look stupid with the way he went down, but as of right now IM SUPER HAPPY!","pos"
"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK","pos"
"Lol PSG got robbed, they blew it but still that dive by Suarez was awful","pos"
"Yea, pretty pathetic. They should be given fines, not penalties. Feel so bad for psg and their fans, absolutely brutal ","neg"
"lol coming from a barca fan. I give them mad credit for pulling off the comeback of a century, beautiful clutch last second goal and Neymar's strike was a gem, but both penalties were weak sauce ","pos"
"Same did PSG but they lost so no one cares.","pos"
"You have no clue what the rules are","pos"
"Diving is not cool. It's against the spirit of the game. He's a cheating bitey cunt.","neg"
"Unbelievable. Honestly the ref probably only gave it because he still thought they had no chance. ","pos"
"So pissed off. What should have been a blatant second yellow for diving turned in to the catalyst for Barca's momentum. Dead and buried until that point.  Also they never showed the Di Maria replay... Was he fouled or not?","pos"
"[deleted]","neg"
"This is a stupid way to put it. Everything from 0-0 right up until 5-1 was still a PSG win. 1 goal decided it yet several of their goals either involved blatant diving or players who shouldn't have been on the pitch (Neymar and Suarez).","pos"
"The second pen? The defender didn't even look at the ball..","neg"
"He said the second penalty call - I'm assuming it was when the long ball was played into Suarez and the defender made no attempt to play the ball, looked straight at Suarez.  I agree on Di Maria's chip, I would need to see it again.","neg"
"Man I at the edge of my life right now, I don't get it    All these people saying how amazing it is etc, call me salty or whatever but I don't think Barcelona deserved the win they had    The referees were clearly in their favor   Bad day","pos"
"Salty? No, just downright moronic. I'd be ashamed if I was you. ","neg"
"When you play Barca, you play more than the 11 men on the field. You play the entire Uefa organisation","pos"
"Robbed? They just blew a 4-0 lead. A dive by Suarez doesn't out weigh that. ","pos"
"No it doesn't. Referees make mistakes in all games, and today we haven't seen more of them usually. Definitely not 6 goals worth of them.  PSG fucked it up. I blame Emery for parking a double decker so deep.","pos"
"Agree 100% with this. But the ref did everything to help Barca","pos"
"Hello people from r/all. Here's a description about the importance of the goal. There's a tournament called the Champions League, where the best teams in Europe play at this stage of the tournament. There are always 2 games between those teams, where one team plays at home and away. Now, the first time they played, Barcelona lost 4-0 to PSG. Everyone thought it was over. There has been 0 teams in the history coming back from such a deficit. No one was really expecting anything, but as the game started, Barcelona scored an early goal. During first half time, Barcelona were leading 2-0 (still 2 goals away). Then, at second half, Barcelona scored another early goal making it 3-0. Now they are 1 goal away. There's about 40 minutes left to play and everyone got hyped up and were looking at an historical moment, atleast for a start. As the hype built up, Barcelona conceded a goal making it 3-1. This means Barcelona must win with atleast 6 goals. This 3-1 scoreline was within the last 20 minutes of the game, and the hype that was built up, was soon vanished. I mean, who can score 3 goals in 20 minutes against a top tier team? Anyway, as the game went on, Barcelona scored 4-1. Everyone was like, meh, a goal that doesn't mean much. Then 5-1 came, with a few more minutes to play. Then the unbelievable happened and they actually turned it around, and the goal in the video is the last goal they needed to advance and qualify, and it really happened. All in all, no one expected a advancement from Barcelona. But as they took the lead early on, everyone was building up hype and soon came the counter goal and the hype was dead until they turned it around by 3 magical last minute goals.   By /u/sutro19  ","pos"
"Somebody should really introduce challenge and cards for diving, fuckin Suarez and Barcelona","pos"
"But diving is okay, right?","pos"
"Suarez did overreacted but there was contact.Its not his fault that he dived because refs do not see contact many times and dont give fouls unless you go down.

"As a person that is coming from all, why is it a big deal that a team won 6-1 vs 5-1? ","pos"
"PSG won the first leg with 4-0 at home. This means that Barca ould have needed a 4-0 as well to go into over time, or a 5-0 to proceed into the next round directly.  PSG scored one goal though. You would think that that means that Barcelona need a 5-1 to go into overtime (making it a 5-5 aggregate), but in soccer there is an away goal rule, in which an away goal is weighed heavier than a home goal, meaning that in case of a 5-5 aggregate, PSG proceeds directly. There can be no extra time.   So, to proceed, Barca needed a 6-1 win, and they did it, going from 3-1 to 6-1 within seven minutes or so.  This is incredible. ","pos"
"PSG won the first game 4-0. That means Barcelona would have to equal that in this second game to send it to extra time, win 5-0 to move on or win by 5 goals if PSG score 1 because of the away goals rule. Basically 185 teams have led 4-0 after the first leg and this is the first time in history a team has come back in the second leg to move on ","pos"
"There are two games played between the teams. The team that advances is based on the combined (aggregate) score between the two games. ","pos"
"They had a four-nil advantage from the first leg, conceded thrice, scored once (giving them an away goal, which count double), then conceded thrice more, leaving them a goal down overall. Hope this helps.","pos"
"Correct, they win 6-5 on aggregate.  What's even more incredible, is they also overturned an away-goal advantage.","pos"
"So I got up and open my computer saw 2:0. Been a barca fan, I am like emm we have a chance. Lets see how it goes.  I went to take a shower and prepare my breakfast. Came back and saw the first penalty. 3:0. Ok Now we are really in it.   I think I shall stay back and watch the rest of game before going to work.  After eating my breakfast, it was 3:1.

Then in tennis we somehow we had another showdown between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in a finals match. Something no one thought we'd see again.

Factors in Bradley's favor:  * Opposing goalkeeper Ochoa was in a much better position than Lloris.  * The altitude at Estadio Azteca (7200 ft/2200 m) makes it harder to get the ball over the keeper and back down.  * Somewhat harder to steal the ball in Bradley's case, whereas Lloris nearly passed it to Toivonen.","pos"

Sometimes players just ""feel it"" and get a great tap of them and send them to just the right place at the right time, which this obviously was because he did it so far out and it knicked the crossbar. This goal is more of a testament to Giroud's instinct than his actual skill. Not to take anything away from this goal, but this took more luck than skill. Giroud is a good striker, but this isn't anything outside the ability of most strikers. It just takes a really good redirect and the gumption of trying something that will result in a loss of possession 99.9% of the time.  ","pos"

He was slinging his foot up trying to make something happen in the box. Give the guy 1000 chances to recreate that goal, and he couldn't. By that undeniable fact, it's a lucky goal. Still sweet, but incredibly lucky.   Idk, it could be that I'm biased, but seeing these types of goals don't impress me as much as something like this: https://streamable.com/0aqy8. How Messi wraps the ball around the outside of his foot at the 57 sec mark is more impressive to me than Giroud's scorpion kick. Idk if it was because I played myself so I know there is a huge luck factor with what Giroud did vs what individual talent actually looks like. I'm not trying to be a dick either.

But give Giroud 1000s chances to recreate that and have him kiss the crossbar like that and he wouldn't be able to replicate it again. That means it was luck. It took some skill of course but every professional striker playing the game in every league on earth has the ability to do what Giroud just did. It's so hard that it will always be unintentional, because no one can actually ""mean to"" place a flick like that  routinely. 1/1000.

"Ignore the downvotes. Seriously. These people don't have a clue what it takes to pull off a circus flick like this routinely, hence why Giroud (or anyone in history) don't have multiple goals doing shit like this. It was a lucky, instinctive flick. Give Giroud 1000 chances to replicate it (kissing the bar and everything) and he wouldn't be able to. Most of his chances wouldn't even make it to the goal, much less actually score on a goalkeeper. It's obvious this was luck. Does it take away from the ""awesomeness"" of it? No, not really. Cool ass circus flick. But does the luck factor take away from the ""impressiveness"" of it? Yes, absolutely.   I posted it here already but I'm more impressed at the 57 sec mark of this video of Messi than I am with Giroud's goal: https://streamable.com/0aqy8. One is a display of godlike skill with a simple tap of the outside foot and the other is a lucky flick that almost anyone can do (it's just that it only happens 1/1000 chances so it's awesome when it does.

"Time for a story.  You may have seen the Nike 'Switch' advert with Cristiano Ronaldo. The eagle eyed among you may have realised that the Charlton Preston game was filmed at Rotherham's New York Stadium. I was a member of the crowd for that game, in fact they also filmed some of the other games there too. This included the England Portugal game.  In the advert you see Harry Kane score in that game and on the day they had, unsurprisingly, a Harry Kane look-a-like. Once everyone was in place the cameras roll. Ball comes to our hero/Cristiano Ronaldo who deftly knocks it to Kane who...skys it! The crowd respond with 'oohs' and hold their heads. To our surprise Kane and others were celebrating. Of course! The ball doesn't need to go in the back of the net, this isn't real life. After a breif telling off by the director we go again, same move and... Kane pulls it wide! We erupt, cheering jumping up and down, the whole works. Take three... Kane misses - the crowd goes wild. And again. And again. I don't know how many times we did this. I started feeling sorry for this guy. We'd got into crowd mindset and the pisstaking echoed around the all but empty stadium. Finally the director calls 'one last take' and we go again the touch to Kane, he shoots and the back of the net ripples! Fuck me he's actually scored! For the first time that day we genuinely cheer, strangers hugging one another, it was a beautiful thing.  Looking back now it makes wonder if it actually was a look-a-like, but it must have been. This guy actually managed to score.","neg"

"God awful performance and it was clear it was gonna be like that from the very first few warm up games!  Seriously this is what needs to happen to even remotely salvage this team going forward:  Hart - Phase out of international football, excellent keeper, but holding back players who don't make mistakes like he does  Cahill - Phase out of international football, quality mind but I see no leadership from him  Smalling - Keep grabbing players like that and you'll be beaten on set pieces every day of the week  Rose and Walker - Learn to beat the fucking man, or fuck off! Sick and tired and seeing these two only seemingly making it to the half way line before releasing the ball when there is often 30-40 yards of space beyond the man ahead of them. The defender either knocks it out of play for a throw in or you beat him and leave him for dead! Can't do that? Fuck off.  Wilshere - Decide what matters, and focus on your club career! If you get better, come back to England, its always there for you. But two games in a season proves you're not capable, physically nor mentally!  Dier - Young and learning, keep pushing and it will get better!  Rooney - Retire from International Football! Get whatever accolades you're close to beating in whatever friendlies come ahead in the next year, but its time to go mate.  Alli - Sort out the mentality and you'll be the #10 for years to come!  Sterling - Composure and desire doesn't always seem to be there, this needs to improve otherwise the 40+ million spent on you will be a disgrace for the performances displayed this tournament.  Kane - Step up as a leader and prove yourself, a top 4 club player, the country will look to you, if you can't cope, you can't lead and you can't win!  Vardy - Age and the season to come will determine whether you are a flash in the pan player! Prove the doubters wrong and earn that CF position outright!   Rashford - Young and with tonnes of heart, keep doing you and work on the composure! You will be the future of this country!

It's like I'm experiencing a deja-vu, because a similar thing happened in my country's league (the Saudi pro league), a small team with a budget of $4 million managed to win the league for the first time in their history in the 2012-2013 season, they managed to best the top 4 teams with budgets around $27 million.   I'm just glad I witnessed a miracle happen and lived it through every week till the end.  Congratulations Leicester City!","pos"

"It's both a great and a sad day for football.   Great because it shows anyone can win and football can be unpredictable.   Sad because they don't have a hope in hell of repeating this next year and therefore it could be considered a complete fluke like Greece in the Euros and Porto &amp; Liverpool in the Champions League. Winners but not great winners or legendary teams which is what we all want to see.  All of the big sides have been poor this season and are going through managerial changes. This season was Arsenal's chance to take the reigns (the last big side in the race) but because they bottled it which opened the door for Leicester or Spurs to win. ","pos"
