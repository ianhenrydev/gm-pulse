"Time for a story.  You may have seen the Nike 'Switch' advert with Cristiano Ronaldo. The eagle eyed among you may have realised that the Charlton Preston game was filmed at Rotherham's New York Stadium. I was a member of the crowd for that game, in fact they also filmed some of the other games there too. This included the England Portugal game.  In the advert you see Harry Kane score in that game and on the day they had, unsurprisingly, a Harry Kane look-a-like. Once everyone was in place the cameras roll. Ball comes to our hero/Cristiano Ronaldo who deftly knocks it to Kane who...skys it! The crowd respond with 'oohs' and hold their heads. To our surprise Kane and others were celebrating. Of course! The ball doesn't need to go in the back of the net, this isn't real life. After a breif telling off by the director we go again, same move and... Kane pulls it wide! We erupt, cheering jumping up and down, the whole works. Take three... Kane misses - the crowd goes wild. And again. And again. I don't know how many times we did this. I started feeling sorry for this guy. We'd got into crowd mindset and the pisstaking echoed around the all but empty stadium. Finally the director calls 'one last take' and we go again the touch to Kane, he shoots and the back of the net ripples! Fuck me he's actually scored! For the first time that day we genuinely cheer, strangers hugging one another, it was a beautiful thing.  Looking back now it makes wonder if it actually was a look-a-like, but it must have been. This guy actually managed to score.",neg

It's a big problem, regardless of whether or not it's commonplace or good strategy. Neymar and Suarez were doing it all game and it certainly paid dividends for the team, which is exactly why people are outraged. Maybe PSG needs to get their shit together and not allow so many goals, but those two penalties were the total difference in the game and both were won by players that spent the entire match flopping around.",neg

"I'm guessing they want this bc the club gets more revenue by being in the top league. The issue though is that if they are exempt and end the season in one of the relegation slots, a team above them will get relegated instead, which will piss them off (for a good reason too). If this occurs, you also have to worry about the quality of the league diminishing due to keeping a team that shouldn't be there.   I think it's great that other teams and groups are trying to help and support this team during a time of tragedy, but these are some implications that I hadn't seen anyone else talk about yet.",neg

"To the people from the frontpage, who came here without any idea what is going on:  This  thread is about football. Not your american football, but the *real* football. This was the second leg of the Round of 16 between Paris Saint German and FC Barcelona in the Champions League. In the first leg Paris won 4-0 and beat the favorites by a huge margin.   There is a special rule about away goals in Football cups like the Champions League. If both legs end with the same goal difference - e g. 2:0 and 1:3, then the team with more away goals reaches the next round. This was the case in the second leg. Paris scored the important away goal, so a 5:1 for Barcelona wouldn't be enough to qualify for the quarter finals. So they needed 6 (!) goals, which was more or less impossible.  In the 88th minute the score was 3:1. So there were only 2 minutes left + 5 minutes of injury time. Barcelona managed to do the impossible and score 3 goals in the last minutes. This video is the last goal in the 90+5th minute of the game, literally the last chance of the match. This match is comparable with the last super bowl match with the Patriots. Unbelievable.",neg

If you are watching this on ABC like I am/was (or an affiliate I guess) stop for a second and try and find the local Spanish language broadcast. For me it's channel two. For a couple of minutes compare the two broadcasts.   The difference is subtle but amazing. The crowd in the English broadcast is dull and muted, they seem subdued. In the Spanish broadcast it is much louder and more active, closer microphones I guess. In the English broadcast the announcers are, with a few exceptions, quiet and soft spoken almost as if they were golf announcers. The Spanish announcers are animated and excited. All in all it is so much more enjoyable.   **Edit** I apologize, I was not aware that this, what I thought to be independent, observations was something that would stir up an angry beehive on this sub.",neg
