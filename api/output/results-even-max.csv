"Everyone watching this, I'd like you to try something. If you are watching this on ABC like I am/was (or an affiliate I guess) stop for a second and try and find the local Spanish language broadcast. For me it's channel two. For a couple of minutes compare the two broadcasts.   The difference is subtle but amazing. The crowd in the English broadcast is dull and muted, they seem subdued. In the Spanish broadcast it is much louder and more active, closer microphones I guess. In the English broadcast the announcers are, with a few exceptions, quiet and soft spoken almost as if they were golf announcers. The Spanish announcers are animated and excited. All in all it is so much more enjoyable.   **Edit** I apologize, I was not aware that this, what I thought to be independent, observations was something that would stir up an angry beehive on this sub.","neg","neg","nan","nan"

"Genuinely happy for him. But honestly has it not been frustrating watching him lately. He's a shadow of his former self and I don't think playing him deeper or on the wing is a good choice when there are players with that as their natural position.   How much time do you guys think he has left at Man U. Now that he has this amazing achievement I would really like to see him move back to Everton or take a new challenge. Like I said, I think Man U is just a cut above what he's capable of.. besides his rare moments of brilliance of course.","neg","neg","nan","nan"

Third, it looks like there is less people because when it rains people who are in the not covered parts go to the most deep zone which is covered by the higher harrow.

"Said before the tournament Rooney's not good enough for the starting 11, and everyone knew that Roy has no tactics.  It's time for some reflection, regrouping and a fresh start for England. Rooney has to go, not a captain, doesn't lead by example and can't even hold his hands up for his obvious drop in ability. At least Hart admitted there's two goals he should be saving.   We need a bold, younger manager who can connect with this young group (like we've seen Poch and less so Southgate with the u21) and find a way to motivate and develop a system that works for the young lads.  Watching this game and England in general in this tournament has been like watching a really shit Man Utd, somewhere between Moyes and early Van Gaal. Honestly think Roy just told them ""Right lads on the wings cross it in, hope for the best""  We have creative players (i.e. Alli, Barkley, Lallana) who can run at defences commit players and cause problems. What did Roy do to them. Honestly worried they'll be mentally scarred for life. What happened to England playing a number 10, like an actual CAM. We've seen glimpses from Sterling, Barkley, Alli, Lallana there to great effect. Yet somehow it's been reduced to hoping our wing backs can win the game..   Cannot bring myself to watch the highlights of this game and don't think I ever will. So much talent, so much wasted opportunity. Even as a liverpool fan I longed to see the physical presence of Barkley learning the CAM role, running at defences. I was looking forward to a slightly rejuvenated Sturridge putting his mark down as our most talented striker, coming close to his prime being utilised. But wait where is he? Oh of course out on the right wing where he was playing, oh yeah back when he was a kid at Chelsea. If you don't play your best players in their best position, you're not going to get the best from them. After the Germany game, we needed tweaks, we looked better without Waz. But no, backwards and downwards and to the wingbacks and out for corners and into the stands and into the abyss of historically depressing England results. Wayne Rooney, aka the new the Scholes, what an absolute joke. He's not Scholes, he's not Pirlo, he's not Gerrard, he's an unfit blobby shade of his former self that will never play at a higher level again. I'd say none of them are fit to wear the shirt but we genuinely have some good young talent. Which makes it all the more painful.  Roy Hodgson and Gary Neville, is that the best you can do FA? Seriously.. 1 WIN IN 2 TOURNAMENTS. Let that sink in. real deep. like really deep. Then remember we beat Germany pre-tournament without Rooney.  Looking forward to a Belgium v France/Italy final. May the best team win. Iceland you've humiliated us, congrats, hope you get demolished next round.","pos","neg","nan","nan"

"I'm 16 years old, my entire group of friends follows soccer and we all have our teams and our rivalries and we pick on each other but at the end of the day we all still love the beautiful game. I have been putting money away and saving for a while and I want to travel to England one day to watch a game. Not because I would get good pictures or take selfies with whomever but because I want to watch the club that I love. I spend my days thinking about soccer. The first half of the week I'm thinking about and discussing the last game and for the second half I think about and discuss the upcoming game. It can be so hard to discuss this with people from Europe because they all take me as a fan who stupidly and randomly picked to support Liverpool ( which in fact I didn't) and only cares about when they when. This just isn't true I have more passion for the club than some actual fans who go to games and just leave when they are losing. I can't even wrap my head around that, your team needs you most when you are losing and that's how you respond, by leaving? It's ludicrous to me it actually is and I can't even fathom that. When I go to England in two years time, I don't care who Liverpool is playing, whether they are winning or losing or if it is an important match, I will be giving it my all to support the players and be a real fan and not someone who shows up for likes on Facebook. I'll sing my voice out a and honestly I sometimes almost come to tears when I hear you'll never walk alone ( particularly after the chapeconese accident). I stick with my team through the losses and wins and whatever is in between. So please people of Europe and Reddit, understand that just because I don't have the money to go to games and just because I'm from America doesn't mean I don't support clubs just as those who are in better scenarios do, and people who go to games, please don't ever leave and please always support even when losing because that's when they need you the most, I can't go and support for a while so I hope this influences some people that go to the Liverpool games or whatever team you support for that matter, to stick around and support, really support and give it your all. I give it my all to my local club even when they lose and when they win and when they need it and don't because I care, I really care about them and the players and their lives and the fans and the coaches and the staff and the club","pos","neg","nan","nan"
